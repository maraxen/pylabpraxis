"""plr_sema.check: the browser-side checker (spec 260901 §6).

**Packaging fact, not a convention.** ``libcst`` ships a Rust native
extension unavailable under Pyodide; importing ``pylabrobot`` to check a
protocol would defeat the point of a static analyzer that runs before the
environment exists. So `check/` (this package) imports NEITHER -- mechanised
by ``tests/test_import_boundary.py::test_no_pylabrobot_import_under_check``
and demonstrated by poisoning both to ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` (AC-6.1).
It also never imports ``pydantic`` (§6.2) -- see ``check/graph.py``'s stdlib
mirror -- and never shells out (no ``git``, no subprocess): the
``SurveyStamp`` an ``AnalysisReport`` carries is deserialized from whatever
the derived-contracts payload already recorded at build time, not
recomputed.

**Round-1 entry point: ``check_graph(graph_json, contracts_json) ->
AnalysisReport``.** Takes two JSON *strings* (matching the ``_json`` naming
and the fact that this function's whole job starts with ``json.loads`` --
neither argument is a pre-parsed dict). ``graph_json`` is the wire format a
(round-2) ``extract/`` would produce, or -- in round 1 -- the committed
fixture generated out-of-process (§6.2, T8; see
``tests/fixtures/simple_transfer_graph.json`` and
``tests/test_check_graph.py``). ``contracts_json`` is
``plr-sema/data/derived_contracts.json`` (§7.3), the build artifact
``plr_sema.derive`` regenerates from the survey.

**260902 (spec §11, "SEMA-IR, the analyzer's middle"): lower-then-check.**
``check_graph``'s SIGNATURE is unchanged, but its body is now: ``json.loads``
both inputs -> build ``param_names`` from the contract table's additive
``params`` key (§11.2.4) -> :func:`plr_sema.check.ir.lower_graph` -> the new
core, :func:`check_ir` (this module) -> relabel through the bytecode's
``sideband["origin"]`` map (§11.4.3, so ``AnalysisReport.findings``'
``operation_id``s are still real graph operation ids, not instruction
indices) -> ``join`` -> ``AnalysisReport``. ``check/graph.py``'s
``OperationNode``/``ResourceNode``/``ProtocolComputationGraph`` mirror is no
longer read by this runtime path at all (§11.4.2) -- it survives as the
lowering's DOCUMENTED input schema, now total over all 34 upstream fields,
and as the comparison target for Fork C's (now exhaustiveness) drift test.
Every v1 verdict, reason, and the shipped fixture's report are UNCHANGED
(AC-11.6) -- this is purely a middle-of-the-pipe substitution, not a
semantics change.

**Every v1 verdict is UNKNOWN (§0, §7.4's forward hazard).** This module
never constructs a ``SAFE`` or ``WILL_FAIL`` ``Finding`` -- §7.4 names the
soundness fence a future round must build before the first ``SAFE`` is ever
emitted, and this module does not attempt to build it. Findings are produced
purely from *derivation-mechanical* facts (§0.2): which pipeline stage
returned nothing for this operation, never a semantic claim about why.

**Per-operation reason logic (mechanics only, no new classification).
Redefined 260901 T11 -- see "unsupported_tool, redefined" below:**

1. ``op.receiver_type is None`` -> ``receiver_type_unknown`` (no contract
   lookup is even attempted -- there is no key to look up).
2. ``f"{op.receiver_type}.{op.method_name}"`` absent from the contract table
   -> ``unsupported_tool``.
3. Otherwise, the resolved ``DerivedContract`` (§7.2/§7.3) is walked:
   * every recorded gap (``unresolved_delegate`` / ``no_contract_derived``,
     the only two ``plr_sema.derive`` ever emits, §7.2) becomes one Finding
     with that same reason;
   * every guard becomes one ``guard_predicate_unparsed`` Finding (§3.3: "a
     guard condition string could not be turned into a predicate"), which is
     unconditionally true in v1 since no predicate parser exists yet.
     (Round-4 remediation, B4: this used to branch to the more specific
     ``argument_not_static`` when a guard's ``free_vars`` intersected
     ``op.depends_on_params``, but that reason has been withdrawn from
     ``REASON_VOCABULARY`` -- the guard-free-var namespace and the
     protocol-parameter namespace it was meant to intersect are disjoint in
     every shipped fixture, so the branch never fired, and a same-named
     collision would have fired it for no semantic cause. See
     ``plr_sema.verdict.REASON_VOCABULARY``'s docstring for the reinstatement
     path.)
   * an operation whose ``foreach_source``/``foreach_body`` is populated
     additionally gets one ``loop_bounds_unknown`` Finding (§3.3: these
     fields identify the loop construct, never its bounds -- bounds are
     deferred item (d)).

**``unsupported_tool``, redefined (260901 T11).** Before T11, step 2 read
``op.method_name not in SUPPORTED_TOOLS`` -- the analyzer's scope was
identical to the dynamic execution harness's 10-tool capability boundary
(``training.verify.dispatcher.SUPPORTED_TOOLS``), because the derived
contract table only ever held entries for those 10 methods, so the two
checks were redundant. T11 decouples derivation from ``SUPPORTED_TOOLS``
(``plr_sema.derive`` now derives a contract for every one of the whole
survey's 4,770 methods, not just the 10 -- see
``plr_sema.derive.__main__.build_derived_contracts_payload``), so the two
checks are no longer redundant, and keeping the ``SUPPORTED_TOOLS`` gate
would have re-imposed the 10-method scope this whole task exists to remove.
``unsupported_tool`` is therefore now defined purely in terms of the
contract table this module actually has in hand: **"key absent from the
contract table"**, i.e. "not resolvable to any method the whole-surface
derivation analyzed" -- not "outside a hand-maintained 10-name allowlist".
``SUPPORTED_TOOLS`` itself is UNCHANGED and still imported/re-exported here
(``__all__``) for ``test_supported_tools_match_upstream`` (AC-6.5) -- it
remains a real thing, just a DIFFERENT boundary now: the dynamic execution
harness's own capability limit (``verify.dispatcher``), which this static
analyzer no longer shares or gates on.

Because the contract table now spans the whole survey rather than only
finding-bearing methods (T11 item 4's zero-findings decision -- see
``build_derived_contracts_payload``'s docstring), a method the survey
scanned but recorded zero ``PreconditionFinding``s for ("known and
unconstrained") gets a real, present, EMPTY contract entry (``guards: []``,
``gaps: []``) rather than an absent key -- so it resolves via step 3 below,
not ``unsupported_tool``, and falls through to the zero-guards/zero-gaps
fallback described next. ``unsupported_tool`` now fires only for a method
name the whole-survey derivation never saw at all: genuinely not part of
the analyzed PLR surface (a typo, a non-PLR receiver, or PLR relocating/
renaming something between the pin the contracts were derived against and
the graph being checked).

**A resolved contract with zero guards, zero gaps, and no loop now
synthesizes one fallback ``no_contract_derived`` Finding (round-4
remediation, B1/B2/§0(ii); this is also T11's answer for the "known,
zero-own-findings, empty-closure" case above -- 2,178 of the 3,456
zero-finding methods at the current pin).** Before round-4's fix, that
combination fell through to an empty finding list for the operation, and --
if it happened for *every* operation in a graph -- ``join(())`` would
return the pre-fix ``SAFE`` default, a live soundness bug on a reachable
public path (a graph with zero operations reaches it trivially; a
resolved-but-empty contract also reaches it). This never fired against the
pre-T11 ``derived_contracts.json`` (all ten ``SUPPORTED_TOOLS`` entries
carried >=1 guard), which is exactly why it went unnoticed then -- the data
never exercised the gap; it fires routinely now that the whole surface
(including genuinely unconstrained methods) is derived. ``join`` (spec
§3.2) now independently treats the empty multiset as UNKNOWN regardless, so
this fallback is defense in depth, not the sole fix -- see
``plr_sema.verdict.join``'s docstring.

    region with a proved trip"): the analysis core. A structured,
    RECURSIVE walk over ``bytecode.instructions`` -- straight-line runs are
    still visited left to right with a program counter, but a ``LOOP``/
    ``BRANCH`` open is now handled by parsing the region's own boundaries
    (:func:`tipstate.region_bounds`) and recursing, rather than by a flat
    region-stack pass. Every ``CALL`` pc **visited** by the walk receives
    ``>=1`` ``Finding``; ``RESOURCE``/``LOOP``/``BRANCH``/``ELSE``/``END``/
    ``WIDEN`` receive none -- they are context, not obligations. A ``CALL``
    inside the body of a proved-``trip == 0`` ``LOOP`` is never visited at
    all (§12.3.4's ``OBLIGED(graph)`` exclusion (2) -- L1 unrolls
    ``min(0, K) = 0`` times) and therefore never receives a ``Finding``,
    which is what makes ``OBLIGED(graph)``, not ``{op.id for op in
    graph.operations if op.node_type is not REGION}``, the right-hand side
    of AC-6.4/AC-7.2/AC-11.7 (all three amended, §12.3.4).

    ``operation_id`` on every emitted ``Finding`` is still ``str(pc)`` --
    unrolling means one ``CALL`` pc can now be visited more than once, so
    one ``operation_id`` can carry more than one guard's worth of findings
    PER ITERATION; the iteration index is threaded into ``Finding.detail``
    (:func:`_with_iteration`), never into ``operation_id`` itself (§12.3.4
    point 2/3). ``check_graph`` relabels through
    ``bytecode.sideband["origin"]`` before constructing an ``AnalysisReport``.

    260902 (spec §10.5/§11.1.3, tip typestate increment): ``receiver_states``
    (the additive ``receiver_state`` top-level block, §10.2) threads a
    :class:`plr_sema.check.tipstate.TipWalk` through this same walk.
    ``None``/``{}`` (a pre-increment contract table, or a caller that never
    passes it -- AC-10.7/AC-11.12's fail-closed degrade) disables tip-state
    entirely: every receiver type is then simply absent from the mapping,
    so :func:`tipstate.evaluate_call` returns ``E5``'s empty result for
    every call, unchanged from pre-increment behavior.

    260903 (spec §12.3, region semantics): a REAL ``LOOP`` with a proved
    integer ``trip`` is visited ``min(trip, K)`` times, threading state from
    one iteration into the next (L1); if ``trip > K`` every receiver
    mentioned anywhere in the region is widened after the ``K``-th
    iteration (the tail widen). A REAL ``LOOP`` with ``trip is None``
    (an unprovable ``while``, or ``for`` over an un-proved extent) iterates
    to a fixpoint over the per-receiver, per-channel join, emitting
    findings from the FINAL (stabilizing) pass only, with a ``K``-pass hard
    cap that widens on overrun (L2). A REAL ``BRANCH`` walks both arms from
    the SAME entry state and joins the two post-states at the merge (B1);
    ``pred`` is never evaluated (B2). The blanket region-entry-and-exit
    widen of pre-260903 behaviour survives ONLY for a SYNTHETIC region --
    the whole-stream ``WIDEN(has_loops)``/``WIDEN(has_conditionals)`` wrap
    ``ir.lower_graph`` falls back to when the extractor emitted no real
    region (L3/B3). L3 additionally RETIRES the stale increment-2
    compensation that used to widen a ``CALL``'s own receiver merely for
    sitting immediately before a ``LOOP``/``BRANCH`` open -- once region
    headers are real (§12.2.2) that adjacency no longer identifies a region
    OWNER, so the rule fired on an unrelated preceding call and silently
    destroyed a real verdict with no diagnostic (round-1 O3; see
    ``tests/test_tip_typestate.py``'s ``test_ac_10_5a``/``test_ac_10_6_condition_expr_widens``,
    now updated to assert the retirement, and the dedicated
    ``call_before_unowned_region_graph.json`` fixture, AC-12.14(iv)).

    260903 (spec §14, volume increment 5): ``env`` (keyword-only, defaults
    to empty -- the same ``cache=`` precedent #4922 added to
    ``check_graph``'s signature, §14.6's normative box) threads the
    hypothesis set into every ``plr_sema.check.volumestate.evaluate_call``
    call. A ``plr_sema.check.volumestate.VolumeWalk`` (``vwalk``) is
    threaded through this same walk, alongside ``walk`` (the tip family's
    own), with its own region-entry/tail widen (V4) and its own
    branch-merge join (interval hull + ``tips_dirty`` OR) -- see
    ``widen_region``/``walk_branch``/``walk_loop`` below. A trip=``None``
    ``LOOP`` region does NOT run volume cells through the K-pass fixpoint
    join tip state uses (V4: the interval lattice has infinite height, so a
    fixpoint over it is not guaranteed to stabilize within any fixed pass
    count -- see §14.5's own non-termination counterexample) -- volume
    cells mentioned in such a region are widened to Top BOTH on entry and
    again after the (tip-state-only) fixpoint returns, so no precision
    ever survives a real ``while``/unproven ``for`` for the volume family,
    regardless of what happens to actually run inside it.

    make the cache observable and falsify the purity premise the cache
    rests on).

    260902 (spec §11, SEMA-IR): the body is lower-then-check --

    ``contracts_payload`` dict. On a hit, the cached PRE-relabel findings
    (§13.3.2's non-obvious half -- ``sideband``/``origin`` is excluded from
    ``bytecode_hash``, so two graphs differing only in operation ids share
    a key and a post-relabel entry would silently return the first graph's
    ids for the second) are relabelled through THIS graph's own
    ``sideband["origin"]``, exactly as a miss would be. On a miss, the
    normal pure computation runs once and its pre-relabel findings are
    stored under the key before relabelling.
