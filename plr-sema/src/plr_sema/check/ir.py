"""plr_sema.check.ir: SEMA-IR, a versioned linear bytecode (spec 260901 §11,
`260902_plr-sema-ir-bytecode-increment.md`).

**Stdlib only.** No ``libcst``, no ``pylabrobot``, no ``pydantic`` (§6.2's
import boundary, unchanged -- see ``plr_sema.check``'s module docstring).
``ast`` is stdlib and permitted (§6.2 bans ``libcst``/``pylabrobot``, not
``ast``; ``plr_sema.derive`` already relies on that same distinction).

**What this module is.** The missing middle between the front end
(``praxis``'s libcst extractor -> ``ProtocolComputationGraph``, out of
process) and the back end (``check_ir`` in ``plr_sema.check``, a pass over
this bytecode). Two lowerings target it: :func:`lower_graph` (from an
extracted-graph JSON payload) and :func:`lower_calls` (from a corpus row's
or a verifier run's PLR-named, already-grounded kwargs -- see
``plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py``'s ``ir_value_of``). Both produce a
:class:`Bytecode`: a linear instruction stream plus a ``sideband`` dict of
everything not hashed (spans, names, the origin map).

**The no-drop invariant (§11.1.4).** Every field of every upstream model
(``OperationNode``, ``ResourceNode``, ``ProtocolComputationGraph``,
``praxis/backend/utils/plr_static_analysis/models.py:524-661``) is assigned
exactly one disposition in :data:`DISPOSITIONS`: **I** (an instruction
field), **W** (a widen trigger), **S** (sideband, never hashed, never read
by ``check_ir``), or **X** (excluded with a written reason -- the three
hand-typed precondition/creates_state fields, §11.1.4's laundering
argument). There is no fifth disposition and no unlisted field --
``tests/test_ir.py::test_disposition_table_is_exhaustive`` (AC-11.1) checks
this against the live upstream field names.

**The WIDEN vocabulary is derived, never typed a second time (§11.1.5,
AC-11.8).** :data:`WIDEN_FIELDS` is computed from :data:`DISPOSITIONS`
itself, and the seven field-name identifiers used at every widen call site
below (``_RECEIVER_TYPE`` etc.) are unpacked FROM ``sorted(WIDEN_FIELDS)`` --
not retyped as string literals -- so the only ``ast.Constant`` occurrence of
each widen-reason string in this file is the one inside ``DISPOSITIONS``
itself. See ``tests/test_ir.py``'s AC-11.8 test for the exact scan and the
resolved-ambiguity note on what "outside the single dict" was relaxed to
mean for call sites that must also *read* the same field name from a
payload dict (unavoidable -- a lookup key and a widen reason are the same
string by construction, per §11.1.5).

    of a real ``ProtocolComputationGraph`` -- the same JSON
    ``plr_sema.check.graph.parse_graph`` reads) into :class:`Bytecode`.

    ``param_names`` maps a contract key (``f"{receiver_type}.{method_name}"``)
    to that method's PLR parameter names (§11.2.4's trust rule). ``None``
    means "trust nothing" -- fail-closed default.

    **Real regions (§12.2, #4932).** The extractor now populates a
    ``GraphNodeType.REGION`` header -- ``method_name == ""``,
    ``receiver_variable == ""``, ``receiver_type is None`` -- for every
    ``for``/``while``/``if`` whose body carries >=1 operation. Such a
    header emits **no** ``CALL`` at all (§12.2.2: it is not an operation
    and carries no obligation) -- just the region alone, ``LOOP``
    (respectively ``BRANCH ... ELSE ... END``), with ``Loop.trip`` read
    straight from the header's own ``trip`` field (§12.2.3's proved value,
    or ``None``).

    **Resolved ambiguity (fixture/fuzz-only region semantics, PRE-#4932
    shape, still supported).** Before real regions existed, the extractor
    never populated ``foreach_source``/``foreach_body``/``condition_expr``/
    ``true_branch``/``false_branch`` on real graphs (§11.1.4's live-data
    caveat) -- this lowering's handling of them was therefore exercised by
    fixtures and the tier-4 hypothesis fuzzer only, and that fixture/fuzz
    shape (a call-bearing, non-``REGION`` operation that ALSO carries its
    own region fields) is still supported unchanged, for backward
    compatibility: (1) such an operation gets its own ``CALL`` (so
    per-operation totality, AC-6.4/AC-11.7, holds even for a loop-carrying
    operation) immediately followed by a ``LOOP null`` region wrapping
    whichever ``foreach_body`` ids resolve to real, not-yet-emitted
    operations (dangling/unresolvable ids -- the common case from the
    tier-4 fuzzer, which never emits a matching id -- are silently
    skipped, not an error: the region still opens and closes validly
    around whatever real content exists, which is what keeps AC-11.13's
    well-formedness total even under fuzzed input). Same shape for
    ``condition_expr``/``true_branch``/``false_branch`` -> ``BRANCH null
    ... ELSE ... END``. This is one reasonable, explicit, total
    interpretation of an underspecified (self-admittedly
    unreachable-from-real-data, at the time) corner; see the task report
    for the alternative considered and rejected (a separate, CALL-less
    "loop header" node) and why it would violate AC-6.4/AC-11.7's totality
    guarantee -- the same argument #4932 later adopted FOR the real
    ``REGION`` shape once headers stopped needing to double as an
    operation's own totality-bearing ``CALL``.

    **Resolved ambiguity (duplicate operation ids, tier-4 fuzz-discovered).**
    A real extractor's ``id`` is documented "Unique identifier for this
    operation", but the wire schema does not structurally forbid a
    duplicate, and the tier-4 hypothesis strategy
    (``tests/test_wire_fuzz.py::operation_id_strategy``) can and does
    generate one. An id-keyed dict (last-write-wins) would silently drop
    every operation but the last with a given id, violating AC-6.4/AC-11.7's
    totality over the REAL operation count, not the unique-id count. This
    lowering therefore tracks CONSUMPTION BY POSITION (a per-id FIFO queue
    of list indices, ``positions_by_id``), never by id membership in a
    ``set`` -- every element of ``operations`` gets exactly one ``CALL``
    regardless of id collisions, and a self-referencing or cyclic
    ``foreach_body``/``true_branch``/``false_branch`` id still terminates
    (each position is poppable at most once).

    overrides, a strict superset. Each ``kwargs`` value is the wire dict
    :func:`value_to_json` would emit, EXCEPT a ``Ref`` is keyed by
    ``"name"`` (a resource variable name) rather than an already-resolved
    ``"slot"`` int -- slot assignment is this function's job (mirroring
    :func:`lower_graph`'s own first-appearance-order assignment), and at
    harvest time (inside ``run_runtime``, one call at a time) there is no
    cross-call slot registry to assign ints against yet. A ``"slot"`` key is
    still accepted for forward compatibility with an already-resolved Value.

    ``resources`` mirrors :func:`lower_graph`'s per-name resource
    declaration dict (``type``/``declared_type``, ``element_type``,
    ``is_container``, ``is_parameter``, ``parents``/``parental_chain``,
    ``items_x``/``items_y``); an entry absent from it still gets a slot
