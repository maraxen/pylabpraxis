"""``python -m plr_sema.derive``: the derivation-pipeline CLI (spec 260901
§7.3/§7.4).

Regenerates the two build artifacts derived from the survey:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run python -m plr_sema.derive \\
        --survey-json training/verify/data/plr_preconditions.json \\
        --out plr-sema/data/derived_contracts.json \\
        --gap-ledger plr-sema/data/gap_ledger.json

``--survey-json PATH`` is REQUIRED, with no default (D19, §7.3): a
hardcoded default would silently couple this workspace-member package to
the caller's repo layout. At least one of ``--out``/``--gap-ledger`` must be
given, or there is nothing to do.

**260901 T13 (backlog #4859): the analyzed surface is a parameter.**
``--plr-root``/``--surface-name``/``--surface-pin`` together name the
``Surface`` (``plr_sema._provenance.Surface``) this run is against, recorded
in the emitted stamp. A second, non-legacy upstream surface (extracted via
``git archive <sha> | tar -x``, no ``.git`` to introspect) is derived the
same way, into DIFFERENT output paths so both coexist on disk:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run python -m plr_sema.derive \\
        --survey-json training/verify/data/plr_preconditions.upstream_nonlegacy.json \\
        --out plr-sema/data/derived_contracts.upstream_nonlegacy.json \\
        --gap-ledger plr-sema/data/gap_ledger.upstream_nonlegacy.json \\
        --plr-root /path/to/extracted/upstream/pylabrobot \\

    indexed -- the WHOLE analyzed PLR surface (4,770 methods across 345
    classes / 28 subpackages at the current pin), not just the 10
    ``SUPPORTED_TOOLS`` names. ``derive_contract`` itself never raises, so
    this never skips a record.

    **Population, not just the 1,314 finding-bearing methods (T11 item 4's
    zero-findings decision).** Every record in ``records`` -- including the
    3,456 that bear no ``PreconditionFinding`` of their own -- gets an entry
    point run through ``derive_contract``. This is NOT free of consequence:
    measured 260901, 580 of those 3,456 zero-own-finding methods inherit
    >=1 REAL guard through their ``delegates_to`` closure (e.g.
    ``PlateReader.read_absorbance`` has zero own findings but delegates to
    ``get_plate``, which has one) -- restricting the payload to
    finding-bearing entry points only, as an entry-point-selection choice,
    would have silently dropped every one of those 580 inherited guards for
    any operation naming one of those methods, which is exactly the
    own-body-only failure mode §7.2 exists to prevent, now recurring one
    level up (at entry-point selection rather than closure-walking). A
    zero-finding method with an empty closure (2,178 measured) still gets
    an entry -- guards=[], gaps=[] -- which ``check/``'s existing "resolved
    contract, zero guards, zero gaps, no loop" fallback (round-4 B1/B2)
    already turns into one ``no_contract_derived`` Finding: "known to the
    survey, unconstrained as far as it sees" is a real, different fact from
    "not resolvable to anything the survey analyzed at all"
    (``unsupported_tool``, redefined by this same task -- see
    ``plr_sema.check``'s module docstring).

    **Keying (T11 item 2, the collision fix).** ``build_index``'s
    ``(module, qualname)`` collapses 12 property/setter pairs at whole-survey
    scale (8 finding-bearing) -- using it here would silently derive a
    contract for only ONE twin per pair and never even attempt the other
    (see ``build_index``'s own docstring). This function therefore iterates
    ``build_unique_index(records)`` (every record individually addressable)
    for entry-point selection, while ``derive_contract``'s own closure walk
    keeps using ``index`` (the collapsing one) for ``resolve()``'s bare-name
    delegate lookup, unchanged -- the two have different jobs and the fix
    only touches the first. Output dict keys come from
    ``build_contract_keys`` -- see its docstring for the two independent
    collision sources (getter/setter pairs; same-named module-level
    functions in different modules) and the ``@module:lineno`` disambiguator.
