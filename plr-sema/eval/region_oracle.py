"""Tier 2b (spec 260903 `260903_plr-sema-real-programs-increment.md`
§12.4.2, backlog #4880/T21): the region-fixture oracle -- EXECUTED ground
truth for `for`/`while`/`if` regions, produced by the instance-level
recorder in :mod:`region_recorder` and compared against the static side
through :func:`plr_sema.check.ir.lower_graph` / `plr_sema.check.check_ir`.

Pipeline per fixture (`plr-sema/eval/fixtures/regions/*.py`):

1. load the module (`LAYOUT`, `protocol`);
2. build a chatterbox deck (`verify.deck.build_setup`) under STRICT + both
   trackers, exactly like `training/verify/verifier.py:104-126`;
3. install a :class:`region_recorder.RegionRecorder` on `setup.machine`,
   `await setup.machine.setup()`, then `await protocol(setup.machine,
   **resources)` -- catching (and recording) the one exception that may
   propagate out;
4. extract the SAME fixture source out of process
   (`extract_runner.py` -- AC-12.16), inject a synthetic `setup` CALL at
   the front of the payload (this file's own `_inject_setup_op` -- see its
   docstring for why: the harness's real `setup()` call happens OUTSIDE
   the fixture source, at a line the extractor never sees, so the graph
   would otherwise never observe a reset at all and #4938's derived
   `entry_reset` effect would never fire), then `lower_graph` -> `check_ir`
   -> relabel;
5. join executed `(method, lineno, visit_index)` to static
   `(operation_id, iteration)` and compare, per spec §12.4.2/AC-12.17.

**The (now-fixed) `OperationNode.line_number` defect, backlog #4948.**
Every operation the extractor emitted used to carry `line_number == 0`
(`computation_graph_extractor.py`'s `_current_line` was initialized once,
in `__init__`, and never assigned again -- this tier's own join was the
first thing to depend on `line_number` being real, which is how the bug
was found). The join was written against the SPEC'S key shape,
`(method_name, lineno)`, from the start, and :func:`_join_key` was the one
place normalizing `lineno` to a constant `0` as a workaround -- see that
function's own docstring for the history. Now that the extractor gives
real line numbers, `_join_key` is an identity pass-through and the join
supports spec §12.4.2's actual rule ("at most one call site per method
per region body"), not just the previous, stronger-than-spec constraint
("at most one call site per PLR method in the whole fixture").
`two_sites_same_method.py` is the fixture that exercises this directly:
two `pick_up_tips` call sites in two different bodies, joined to two
different operations. :func:`_build_join_map` still raises loudly
(`region_recorder.DuplicateCallSiteError`) on a genuine same-body
same-method duplicate.

    path (spec 260903 #4938's row: "plr-sema/eval/ prepends the
    scaffolding reset call ... with origin == 'setup'"), adapted here to
    the ``lower_graph`` payload shape because tier 2b goes through
    ``lower_graph``, not ``lower_calls``.

    **Why injection, not a literal ``await lh.setup()`` line in the
    fixture source (§12.4.2's other offered option).** The harness (see
    :func:`run_fixture`) calls ``await setup.machine.setup()`` exactly
    once, OUTSIDE the fixture body, mirroring
    ``training/verify/verifier.py``'s own "DeckFactory setup -> await
    lh.setup() -> execute" run pattern precisely (this file's own
    docstring quotes it). Also writing ``await lh.setup()`` as the
    fixture's own first statement would make it run TWICE at runtime, and
    the recorder would record its harness-side call at the HARNESS's own
    source line, not any line inside the fixture -- a call site the
    static side could never join against regardless. Injecting a
    synthetic op instead keeps the fixture executing setup() exactly once
    (matching the harness's real, single call) while still giving
    ``check_ir``'s E6 (#4938's derived reset effect) a CALL to observe:
    E6 only checks ``call.method == entry_reset.method`` (`"setup"`,
    `derived_contracts.json`'s own `receiver_state.LiquidHandler
    .entry_reset`), never the call's line or position, so a synthetic
    op ahead of every real one is sufficient and never itself compared

    `lineno` to a constant `0` on both sides -- `_current_line` was
    assigned once in `ComputationGraphExtractor.__init__` and never again,
    so every extracted operation carried `line_number == 0`, while
    `sys._getframe(1).f_lineno` on the EXECUTED side
    (`region_recorder.py`) read a real, distinct CPython frame line per

    match a `(method, 0)` static key, so the join degraded to
    `method_name` alone -- safe only because every fixture in

    spec §12.4.2's own ("at most one call site per method per region
    body"): at most one call site per PLR method in the WHOLE fixture.

    Now that `line_number` is real, this is the identity pass-through the

    function (rather than inlined at both call sites) so a future
    normalization need has one obvious place to live, and so
    `two_sites_same_method.py` (two DIFFERENT `pick_up_tips` call sites in
