"""The tier-2b executed-ground-truth recorder (spec 260903
`260903_plr-sema-real-programs-increment.md` §12.4.2, backlog #4880/T21,
AC-12.17).

**Not `plan_call`** (round-1 O1). A region fixture is a real coroutine
containing a real Python ``for``/``while``/``if`` -- it is executed
directly (``await protocol(lh, ...)``), never replayed as a
``call_sequence`` list, so ``training/verify/dispatcher.py``'s
``plan_call`` -- reached only from ``verifier.py``'s own
``for i, call in enumerate(call_sequence)`` loop -- structurally cannot
observe anything inside a real loop body. This module wraps the tool
methods on the receiver **instance** ``build_setup`` returns instead.

**Instance-level, not class-level.** :meth:`RegionRecorder.install` sets a
bound-method-shaped attribute directly on the receiver *object*
(``setup.machine``), never on ``type(setup.machine)`` -- so nothing global
is patched and no other test (or concurrent fixture run) can observe the
wrap. :meth:`RegionRecorder.uninstall` removes the instance attribute,
which reveals the class's own method again (Python attribute lookup falls
through instance -> class when the instance ``__dict__`` entry is
deleted) -- the class object itself is never touched.

**The call-site key is the CALLER's source line**, read via
``sys._getframe(1).f_lineno`` from inside the wrapper -- frame 0 is the
wrapper's own body, frame 1 is whichever fixture statement is doing the
``await lh.pick_up_tips(...)``. A monotonic per-key visit counter turns
repeat visits of the same source line (a loop body revisited on each
iteration) into an ordered ``visit_index`` sequence -- 1, 2, 3, ... --
which is what lets :mod:`region_oracle` line an executed visit up against
the static side's unrolled ``iteration N`` findings (spec §12.3.4 point 2).
