"""Shared oracle infrastructure: runtime/static/compare pipeline.

Factored from plr-sema/scripts/oracle_spike.py (260902 spike). This module is
imported by both the oracle_spike.py worked example and the tier-1 corpus-replay
harness (oracle_replay.py). Module-level imports avoid plr_sema.src.* (a
circular-dependency hazard at IMPORT TIME, not a boundary the import-boundary
test enforces here -- that test is scoped to src/plr_sema/, and eval/ is
explicitly permitted to import pylabrobot/training.verify/plr_sema, spec
§11.2.2's "Where it lives"); every plr_sema import below is therefore done
LAZILY, inside a function body, after inserting plr-sema/src onto sys.path
-- the same pattern this module already used for check_graph before 260902.

260902 (spec §11, SEMA-IR): ``adapt_graph`` is DELETED. The corpus path now
lowers through :func:`plr_sema.check.ir.lower_calls` over PLR-named,
already-grounded kwargs (:func:`ir_value_of`, harvested by
:func:`run_runtime`'s ``recording_plan_call`` wrapper) instead of adapting a
call sequence into a §6.2 graph payload keyed by tool-named/guessed
argument names. ``run_static`` (the graph-payload path, still used by a
future tier-2 source-render harness) is UNCHANGED; :func:`run_static_calls`
is its new sibling for the ``lower_calls`` path.
