"""Spec 260901 §3.4 / AC-3.1-3.4: verdict/finding/report record shape.

The six test functions named in §3.4's bullet list
(test_join_truth_table, test_no_bool_protocol,
test_will_fail_requires_category, test_unknown_requires_reason,
test_reason_vocabulary_closed, test_report_round_trips_json).
test_join_truth_table and test_reason_vocabulary_closed's real behavior
inflate the *collected* count above six via parametrization / internal
sub-checks -- the *named* function count stays six, matching AC-3.1's "all
six test_verdict.py tests pass." **Round-4 remediation (M7) adds one more,
un-named-in-§3.4 function, `test_join_absorbs_across_shared_operation_id`**,
covering a case none of the six named tests' parametrization ever reaches
(two findings sharing one `operation_id`) -- AC-3.1 is unaffected (it is
still satisfied by the six named functions all passing), this is additive.
**260901 (§Open decisions 1) adds one more, `test_from_wire_maps_
unrecognized_string_to_unknown`**, covering the new consumer rule
(`Verdict.from_wire`); also additive, per AC-3.1's note (§3.6, R15) that a
hard-coded test count is not the gate -- "all tests pass" is.

    -- `_finding_for` sets `operation_id=f"op{index}"`, so every multiset of
