"""Spec 260901 §5.3 "Fork C" / §5.6 AC-5.5 / D8, STRENGTHENED 260902 by §11
(``260902_plr-sema-ir-bytecode-increment.md``, §11.4.2/§11.7 AC-11.1) from a
SUBSET check into an EXHAUSTIVENESS check.

Lives under `tests/`, which spec §1.3's boundary walk does NOT cover (that
walk is scoped to `src/plr_sema/`) -- so, unlike anything under `src/`, this
file MAY import `praxis.backend.utils.plr_static_analysis.models`. Compares
`plr_sema.check.graph`'s mirror dataclasses' field names against the live
pydantic models' `model_fields` keys, in BOTH directions, for all THREE
models (`OperationNode`, `ResourceNode`, and -- new in this file --
`ProtocolComputationGraph`).

**Why exhaustiveness, not subset (260902 supersession).** Through
spec_version 9, `check/graph.py`'s field set was "derived-from-consumers,
normative" (D1): a field was mirrored iff a consumer needed it, and this
test only checked `mirror_fields <= upstream_fields` -- it could not see
OVER-inclusion relative to a §6.2 table (a second test,
`test_mirror_field_set_matches_spec_table`, covered that by comparing
against a hand-transcribed literal list). SEMA-IR's no-drop invariant
(§11.1.4) replaces "which fields does a consumer need" with "every field
gets exactly one disposition", and the mirror grows from a hand-chosen
subset to the FULL upstream field set -- so the correct comparison is now
equality, and a single test suffices: `mirror_fields == upstream_fields`,
both directions. A field added upstream now turns THIS test red (previously
it would pass silently, since subset-only cannot detect a missing field);
a mirrored field that no longer exists upstream still turns it red, as it
always did.

Fails CLOSED (an assertion, not a skip) whenever `praxis` is importable in
the running test environment (spec §5.5's Fork C failure-mode note) --
converting a silent runtime gap (a mirrored field that no longer exists
upstream, producing a silent None/KeyError at `json.loads` time rather than
an import-time error, since the mirror never imports the pydantic model to
fail against) into a red test at review time. Only skips, with an explicit
reason, when `praxis` genuinely is not importable in this environment.

**Relationship to `tests/test_ir.py`'s AC-11.1.** That test checks
`plr_sema.check.ir.DISPOSITIONS` -- the disposition table itself -- against
field names read by AST/regex directly off `models.py` (no pydantic
import, environment-independent). This file checks a DIFFERENT thing: that
`check/graph.py`'s dataclass mirror (the lowering's documented input
schema, §11.4.2) has not drifted from the LIVE pydantic model. The two
together give environment-independent AND live-import coverage; neither
substitutes for the other.
