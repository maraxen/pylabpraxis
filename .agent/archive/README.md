# Archive

> Historical records of completed tasks and artifacts.

## What Goes Here

Completed task directories moved from `tasks/` after work is done. Preserves context for future reference without cluttering active workspaces.

## How to Use

1. **Archive completed tasks**: Move `tasks/{id}_name/` here when DONE
2. **Reference old work**: Search here for past implementations
3. **Retention**: Keep for 30+ days, then consider deletion
