+# Maintenance Audit Prompt
+
+## Usage
+Run this prompt periodically to maintain `.agents/` health. This prompt guides you through a series of checks to identify and resolve common maintenance issues.
+
+## Steps
+
+### 1. Check for Stale Files
+- **Goal**: Identify and archive files that haven't been modified in the last 30 days.
+- **Action**: Run the following command to find files older than 30 days:
+  ```bash
+  find .agents -type f -mtime +30
+  ```
+- **Recommendation**: For each file identified, evaluate if it's still relevant. If not, move it to the `.agents/archive` directory.
+
+### 2. Review Archive Directory
+- **Goal**: Ensure the `.agents/archive` directory doesn't contain anything that should be active or that can be deleted.
+- **Action**: List the contents of the archive:
+  ```bash
+  ls -l .agents/archive
+  ```
+- **Recommendation**: Review the archived files. Delete anything that is no longer needed. If a file is still relevant, consider moving it back to an active directory.
+
+### 3. Scan for TODO/FIXME Comments
+- **Goal**: Find and address any outstanding action items or fixes noted in the codebase.
+- **Action**: Use `grep` to search for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments within the `.agents/` directory:
+  ```bash
+  grep -r "TODO" .agents/
+  grep -r "FIXME" .agents/
+  ```
+- **Recommendation**: For each comment found, create a task or address the issue directly.
+
+### 4. Identify Orphaned Artifacts
+- **Goal**: Find any artifacts (e.g., old reports, temporary files) that are no longer associated with any active tasks or prompts.
+- **Action**: Manually review the contents of the `.agents/` directory, looking for files that don't seem to have a purpose.
+- **Recommendation**: If you find any orphaned files, either archive or delete them.
+
+### 5. Suggest Maintenance Actions
+- **Goal**: Based on the audit, suggest a set of maintenance actions.
+- **Action**: Review the findings from the previous steps.
+- **Recommendation**: Create a summary of the necessary actions, such as:
+  - "Archive the following files: [list of files]"
+  - "Delete the following files from the archive: [list of files]"
+  - "Address the following TODO/FIXME comments: [list of comments]"
+  - "Remove the following orphaned artifacts: [list of artifacts]"
