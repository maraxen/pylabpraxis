+# RECON - Repository Cleanup Audit
+
+This report identifies stale files, duplicate information, and consolidation opportunities to improve repository hygiene.
+
+## 1. Stale Files
+
+A number of files in the repository root appear to be temporary, transitional, or obsolete.
+
+| File | Recommendation | Rationale |
+| :--- | :--- | :--- |
+| `implementation_plan.md` | Archive | This is a detailed plan for a past feature ("State Inspection & Reporting Enhancement") and is now historical. |
+| `modified_changes.diff` | Delete | A patch file that appears to have been accidentally committed. |
+| `temp_state_size_test.py` | Delete | A temporary, standalone test script. If needed, it should be integrated into the main test suite. |
+| `test_resolve_params.py` | Delete | Another orphaned test script. |
+| `port_docstrings.py` | Move to `scripts/` | A one-off utility script that fits better in the `scripts` directory. |
+| `praxis.db` | Delete & Add to `.gitignore` | A local development SQLite database that should not be tracked in version control. |
+| `walkthrough.md` | Move to `docs/getting-started/` | This is user documentation and should be co-located with other guides. |
+
+## 2. Duplicate Content & Consolidation
+
+High-level project management and planning documents are scattered in the root directory. There is an opportunity to consolidate them for clarity.
+
+### Consolidation Recommendations
+
+Create a new directory `docs/project/` and move the following files into it:
+
+- `POST_SHIP.md`
+- `ROADMAP.md`
+- `RUNWAY.md`
+- `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`
+- `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`
+
+This change will group related project-level documents and declutter the root directory.
+
+## 3. Files to Archive
+
+The `references/` directory contains valuable historical audits and analyses. These are not active documents and are excellent candidates for archival to reduce top-level clutter.
+
+### Archival Recommendations
+
+The entire `references/` directory should be moved to `.agent/archive/references/`. This preserves the content for historical context while removing it from the active project structure.
+
+- `references/machine_sim_audit.md`
+- `references/protocol_asset_audit.md`
+- `references/qa_interaction_checklist.md`
+- `references/resource_error_log.md`
+- `references/state_gap_analysis.md`
+- `references/styling_audit_report.md`
+- `references/suite_comprehensiveness_analysis.md`
+- `references/test_plan_v1.md`
+- `references/workcell_ui_audit.md`
+
+## Summary of Recommendations
+
+### Files to Delete (4)
+- `modified_changes.diff`
+- `praxis.db`
+- `temp_state_size_test.py`
+- `test_resolve_params.py`
+
+### Files to Move/Consolidate (7)
+- `port_docstrings.py` -> `scripts/`
+- `walkthrough.md` -> `docs/getting-started/`
+- `POST_SHIP.md` -> `docs/project/`
+- `ROADMAP.md` -> `docs/project/`
+- `RUNWAY.md` -> `docs/project/`
+- `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` -> `docs/project/`
+- `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` -> `docs/project/`
+
+### Files to Archive (10)
+- `implementation_plan.md` -> `.agent/archive/`
+- The entire `references/` directory and its contents.
+
+This list identifies over 10 items and provides clear, actionable recommendations for cleanup.
