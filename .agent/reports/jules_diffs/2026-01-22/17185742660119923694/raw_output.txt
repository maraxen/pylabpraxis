+# RECON Report: Playwright Usage for Jules
+
+This report documents the current Playwright setup in the `praxis/web-client` application and provides a recommended approach for Jules to run end-to-end tests.
+
+## 1. Current Playwright Configuration Summary
+
+The Playwright setup is configured in `praxis/web-client/playwright.config.ts`.
+
+- **Configuration File**: `praxis/web-client/playwright.config.ts`
+- **Test Directory**: `praxis/web-client/e2e/specs`
+- **Web Server**: The configuration includes a `webServer` block that automatically starts the Angular development server using `npm run start:browser -- --port 4200` before running tests. The server runs on `http://localhost:4200`.
+- **Browser**: The tests are configured to run against Chromium.
+- **Reporter**: A simple `list` reporter is used for console output.
+- **Parallelism**: Tests run in parallel by default, but this is disabled on CI (`workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined`).
+
+## 2. Jules Execution Requirements
+
+As an AI agent, my execution environment has specific requirements:
+
+- **Headless Mode**: All browser tests must run in headless mode, as there is no graphical user interface.
+- **Self-Contained Commands**: The test command must be executable from the command line without manual intervention.
+- **Server Management**: The command should handle starting and stopping the web application server automatically.
+- **Dependency Management**: The process should rely on the project's existing dependencies.
+
+## 3. Headless Mode Verification
+
+The existing configuration is well-suited for my execution environment. The `playwright.config.ts` file explicitly enables headless mode in two places:
+
+1.  In the global `use` block: `headless: true`
+2.  In the `chromium` project configuration: `use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], headless: true }`
+
+This ensures that all tests will run without requiring a graphical interface, which is ideal.
+
+## 4. Recommended Test Command for Jules
+
+To execute the Playwright test suite, I should use the following command:
+
+```bash
+cd praxis/web-client && npx playwright test
+```
+
+**Rationale**:
+
+- **Working Directory**: The command must be run from the `praxis/web-client` directory, as `playwright.config.ts` and `package.json` are located there.
+- **`npx`**: Using `npx` ensures that the locally installed version of Playwright from `node_modules` is used, avoiding potential version conflicts.
+- **`playwright test`**: This is the standard command to invoke the Playwright test runner, which will automatically use the `playwright.config.ts` file.
+
+This single command handles starting the web server, running all tests in headless mode, and shutting down the server.
+
+## 5. Known Issues & Gotchas
+
+- **No npm Script**: There is no dedicated npm script (e.g., `npm run test:e2e`) in `package.json`. I must always use the full `npx playwright test` command.
+- **Initial Browser Download**: The first time `npx playwright test` is run, it may take some time to download the necessary browser binaries. This is expected behavior.
+- **Agent Skills (`.agent/skills`)**: The repository contains agent skills related to Playwright (`playwright-skill` and `webapp-testing`). While these provide general testing patterns, they are not tailored to this project's specific setup. **I should ignore these skills and use the project's native test command**, which is simpler and more reliable as it leverages the existing configuration.
