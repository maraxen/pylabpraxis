-# Asset Selection Logic & Status Report
-
-**Date:** 2026-01-21
-**Component:** `RunProtocolComponent` > `GuidedSetupComponent`
-
-## 1. Overview
-
-The asset selection phase is Step 4 in the Run Protocol wizard. Its purpose is to map abstract **Asset Requirements** defined in the protocol (e.g., "1x 96-well PCR Plate") to concrete **Inventory Resources** (e.g., "plate_123").
-
-## 2. Architecture & Data Flow
-
-* **Host:** `RunProtocolComponent` coordinates the wizard.
-* **Logic Handler:** `GuidedSetupComponent` (`app-guided-setup`) executes the matching logic.
-* **Input:** `ProtocolDefinition.assets` (List of requirements).
-* **Inventory Source:** `AssetService.getResources()` (Fetches full inventory).
-* **Output:** `configuredAssets` signal (Map: `accession_id` -> `Resource`).
-
-## 3. Matching Logic (`getCompatibleResources`)
-
-The system employs a multi-strategy approach to find compatible inventory items for a given requirement. A resource is considered compatible if it satisfies **any** of the following strategies (checked in order), provided it is **not a Carrier**:
-
-1. **Exact FQN Match:** `resource.fqn` === `requirement.fqn`
-2. **Class Name Match:** The last part of the FQN matches (e.g., `...Plate96` matches `...Plate96`).
-3. **Type Hint Match:** The `requirement.type_hint_str` is found within the resource's class name.
-4. **Category Match:** (High Priority) If `requirement.required_plr_category` is set, it matches against the resource's PLR definition category.
-
-**Constraint:** Carrier resources are explicitly excluded from this selection step (they are handled in Deck Setup).
-
-## 4. Auto-Selection Algorithm (`autoSelect`)
-
-To reduce user effort, the system attempts to auto-fill selections when the step loads:
-
-1. **Scope:** Iterates through all requirements in the protocol.
-2. **Exclusion:** Skips requirements that already have a manual selection.
-3. **Search:** Finds all compatible resources for the requirement.
-4. **Prioritization:** Separation into "Exact Matches" (FQN match) and "Other Compatible". Exact matches are preferred.
-5. **Availability Check:** Maintains a local `usedResourceIds` set to ensure a physical resource is not assigned to multiple requirements within the same run.
-6. **Assignment:** Selects the first available candidate and marks the requirement as `Autofilled`.
-
-## 5. Validation Rules
-
-* **Required Fields:** The step is invalid if any **non-optional** requirement has no assigned resource.
-* **Optional Fields:** Can be left empty (`null`).
-
-## 6. Current Status & Limitations
-
-### ✅ Working Features
-
-* **Robust Matching:** The 4-layer matching strategy covers most use cases (specific vs generic).
-* **Auto-Complete:** Reduces setup time significantly.
-* **Visual Feedback:** Clear badges for "Auto", "Set", and "Optional".
-* **Inline/Dialog Mode:** Component works both inside the wizard (`isInline=true`) and as a standalone dialog.
-
-### ⚠️ Identified Gaps (Technical Debt)
-
-1. **Missing Inspection UI:** Users cannot click an asset to see its details (e.g., volume, remaining quantity). This was confirmed via deep research (Dispatch `d260121152102336_4225`).
-2. **Status Filtering:** The logic currently does not appear to filter out resources based on their global status (e.g., `IN_USE`, `DEPLETED`). It relies on the user or the `AssetService` logic (which currently returns all items).
-3. **Strictness:** The "Type Hint" match (Strategy 3) uses `string.includes()`, which might be too loose for complex inventories (e.g., "Plate" matching "PlateLid").
-
-## 7. Investigation Addendum
-
-**Topic:** Asset Selection UI Capabilities
-
-### Findings
-
-1. **Dialog vs. Autocomplete:**
-    * **Current State:** There is **NO** option for a dedicated dialog to select items. The UI exclusively uses `app-praxis-autocomplete` (lines 97-102 of `guided-setup.component.ts`) for item selection.
-    * **Implication:** Users can only search and select via the dropdown. They cannot browse a full table or view detailed metadata in a separate modal during selection.
-
-2. **Reselection Logic:**
-    * **Feasibility:** The code supports reselection. The `updateSelection` method (line 655) updates the `selectedAssets` signal, which is bound to the autocomplete's `ngModel`.
-    * **Behavior:**
-        * When a user manually changes a selection, the `autofilledIds` set is updated to remove that requirement ID (lines 667-672), ensuring the "Auto" badge is replaced by "Set" (or nothing).
-        * This explicit state management confirms that **manual reselection is intended and logically supported**, overriding any initial auto-selection.
-    * **Testing:** There are **NO** unit tests for `GuidedSetupComponent` (`guided-setup.component.spec.ts` does not exist). Therefore, while the logic appears sound, it has likely **not been rigorously tested** for edge cases (e.g., clearing a selection, re-selecting the same auto-filled item).
-
-3. **Retriggering Autoselection:**
-    * **Availability:** There is **NO** button in the UI to manually retrigger the `autoSelect()` logic.
-    * **Execution:** `autoSelect()` is only called once: inside the `ngOnInit` subscription block (line 381) when the inventory is first loaded.
-    * **Consequence:** If a user manually clears several selections and wants to "reset" to the system's best guess, they must reload the entire component/wizard step.
-
-## 8. Recommendations
-
-1. **Implement specific click handlers** for asset rows to trigger a `ResourceDetailsDialog`.
-2. **Enhance filtering** to exclude `DEPLETED` resources automatically.
-3. **Add "In Use" warnings** if a selected resource is currently active in another run (requires backend support).
-4. **Add Reset Button:** Implement a "Reset to Defaults" or "Auto-Fill" button in the summary section (near line 111) that calls `autoSelect()`. This would allow users to recover from accidental manual changes.
-5. **Verify Reselection:** Create a unit test suite (`guided-setup.component.spec.ts`) to specifically verify that `updateSelection` correctly handles null values (clearing) and new resource assignments, and updates the `autofilled` state accordingly.
-6. **Add Clear Selection Button:** Add an explicit "Clear" button to each selection row to allow users to easily unassign a resource without needing to search/select 'null'.
-7. **Reuse Existing Components:** When implementing the detailed item selection dialog, strictly **reuse existing components** to maintain consistency. Options include:
-    * `ResourceInstancesDialog` or `AssetList` (standard lists).
-    * `AssetSelectionWizard` (with the first step bypassed to focus purely on resource selection).
-    * **Action:** Review these candidates to determine the best approach before implementation.

-# Investigation Report: Backend Categories in Inventory
-
-**Task ID**: 260121152847
-**Status**: INVESTIGATION COMPLETE
-**Review**: Fix was INCOMPLETE and introduced regressions in Browser Mode.
-
-## 1. Original Fix Analysis
-
-- **Commit**: `40375a78` "feat(app): standardize PLR category filtering..."
-- **Change**: Updated `AssetWizard.ts` to filter search results using `map(defs => defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === 'Machine'))`.
-- **Finding**: This fix effectively hides backend definitions from the **search results**, BUT only if the `plr_category` field is present.
-
-## 2. Issues Identified
-
-### A. Browser Mode Regression (Critical)
-
-In Browser Mode (using `SqliteService`), the `MachineDefinition` objects retrieved from SQLite **DO NOT have the `plr_category` field populated**.
-
-- `sqlite.service.ts` seeds from `PLR_MACHINE_DEFINITIONS`.
-- `PLR_MACHINE_DEFINITIONS` in `plr-definitions.ts` lacks the `plr_category` property (it uses `machine_type`).
-- **Consequence**: `d.plr_category` is `undefined`.
-- **Result**: `d.plr_category === 'Machine'` evaluates to `false` for ALL machines.
-- **Impact**: **Users in Browser Mode cannot find ANY machines in the Asset Wizard.**
-
-### B. Incomplete Category Filtering (The Reported Issue)
-
-The user report states "Categories STILL showing backend types". This refers to the **Category Dropdown** in the wizard.
-
-- **Code Path**: `AssetWizard.ngOnInit` -> `this.categories$`.
-- **Source**: `AssetService.getMachineFacets()`.
-- **Browser Mode Logic**: Counts `machine_category` from definitions.
-- **Production Mode Logic**: Calls `MachinesService.getMachineDefinitionFacets...`.
-- **Finding**:
-  - The `categories$` observable is **NOT filtered** by `plr_category === 'Machine'` in `AssetWizard.ts`.
-  - If the Backend API (Production) returns facets for "Backend" or uses "Backend" as a `machine_category` for backend definitions, they will appear in the dropdown.
-  - The "Fix" only applied to `searchMachineDefinitions` (the result list), NOT `getMachineFacets` (the category list).
-
-## 3. Root Cause
-
-1. **Browser Mode**: Data Integrity Issue. `plr_category` is missing from SQLite seed data/mapping.
-2. **General/Production**: Incomplete UI Logic. The `categories$` stream is not filtered to exclude non-Machine categories, relying entirely on the backend to filter facets (which it apparently isn't fully doing, or returns mixed types).
-
-## 4. Recommendations
-
-### Immediate Fixes
-
-1. **Polyfill Browser Mode**: Update `AssetService.getMachineDefinitions` (in the `isBrowserMode` block) to manually inject `plr_category: 'Machine'` for all definitions coming from the `machine_definitions` table (which is safe as it only stores machines).
-2. **Filter Dropdown**: Update `AssetWizard.ts` to filter the `categories$` stream to exclude known backend types if they leak through, OR update `AssetService.getMachineFacets` to strictly filter its source data before counting.
-
-### Long Term
-
-- Standardize `MachineDefinition` to always include `plr_category` in all layers (DB, API, Types).
-- Add explicit test coverage for Browser Mode asset searching.
-
-## 5. Verification
-
-- **Browser Mode**: Verify `AssetWizard` search works again (currently broken).
-- **Inventory**: Verify "Backend" is gone from the Category list.

-
-## Missing Error Handling
-
-- [ ] `ResourceAccordionComponent.loadData()` - Subscribes to `getResources`, `getResourceDefinitions`, and `getMachines` without any error handling blocks.
-- [ ] `ProtocolLibraryComponent.loadProtocols()` - Uses `console.error` only; no UI feedback for failed fetches.
-- [ ] `ProtocolLibraryComponent.uploadProtocol()` - Only logs error to console; user is not notified if upload fails.
-- [ ] `MachineListComponent.loadMachines()` / `loadMachineDefinitions()` / `deleteMachine()` - All use `console.error` for errors; needs a snackbar or error state UI.
-
-## Incomplete Features
-
-- [ ] **Asset Management**: Machine and Resource editing/duplication are placeholders only.
-- [ ] **Resource Lifecycle**: Marking resources as discarded or sending them for cleaning is not implemented.
-- [ ] **Resource Creation**: The "Add Instance" button in the instances dialog is a placeholder.
-- [ ] **Protocol Details**: Detailed view for protocols is missing source code preview and parameter validation preview.
-
-## Manual Verification Needed
-
-- [ ] **SQLite Integration**: Verify that `AssetService` correctly interacts with the SQLite service in `BrowserMode` for all CRUD operations.
-- [ ] **Real Utilization Data**: Ensure machine utilization charts switch from random data to actual historical data once exposed by the backend.
-- [ ] **Protocol Upload**: Test the `.py` file upload flow end-to-end to ensure proper parsing on the backend.
-- [ ] **AppStore State**: Verify that global settings like `infiniteConsumables` correctly update the UI state across different views.

-# Component Audit: Playground & Run Protocol
-
-## Mock Data / Hardcoded Values
-
-### Playground
-

-
-### Run Protocol
-
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/execution.service.ts:71`: `getCompatibility` returns hardcoded/mock compatibility data in browser mode.
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/execution.service.ts:366`: `startRun` generates simulation placeholder code if protocol import fails.
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/deck-generator.service.ts:12`: `DEFAULT_DIMENSIONS` constant used as fallback for resource dimensions.
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/deck-catalog.service.ts:34`: Hardcoded Hamilton STAR rail spacing and offsets.

-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/carrier-inference.service.ts:11`: Hardcoded `CARRIER_COMPATIBILITY` map.
-
-## TODO Comments
-
-### Playground
-
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/playground/services/device-manager.service.ts`: (implied) Error handling for WebSerial permission denial is minimal.
-
-### Run Protocol
-
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/deck-generator.service.ts:87`: `state: {} // TODO: Populate state if needed`
-- [ ] `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/components/deck-setup-wizard/deck-setup-wizard.component.ts:337`: `// TODO: Add confirmation dialog` in `onSkip()`.
-
-## Missing Error Handling
-
-- [ ] `PlaygroundComponent.insertAsset`: `catch` block catches permission errors but generic handling is "Failed to check hardware permissions".
-- [ ] `ExecutionService.executeBrowserProtocol`: `catch` block handles execution errors but `pythonRuntime.executeBlob` error propagation could be more granular (currently just logs to console/UI log).
-- [ ] `DeckGeneratorService.getResourceDimensions`: Silently catches errors and falls back to defaults (`console.debug` only).
-
-## Incomplete Features
-
-- [ ] **Deck Auto-Placement**: `DeckGeneratorService` has commented out logic for placing assigned assets (`// Removed auto-placement logic`), relying on starting empty.
-- [ ] **Carrier Inference**: `CarrierInferenceService` uses string matching (`name.includes('plate')`) which is brittle compared to proper type checking against the definition.
-- [ ] **Browser I/O Shims**: `web_serial_shim.py` and `web_usb_shim.py` are dynamically fetched/injected. If these assets are missing, the REPL will fail to initialize hardware support silently or with a generic error.
-
-## Manual Verification Needed
-
-- [ ] **WebSerial Handling**: Verify `PlaygroundComponent` correctly asks for permission and handles "Cancel" in the permission dialog.
-- [ ] **JupyterLite Boot**: Verify `getOptimizedBootstrap` correctly injects the Python shims and `pylabrobot` wheel without 404s.
-- [ ] **Deck Visualization**: Verify `DeckSetupWizard` correctly renders the inferred deck layout (carriers + resources) despite `DeckGeneratorService` stripping some logic.
-- [ ] **Protocol Simulation**: Verify `ExecutionService` correctly runs the "simulation placeholder" path when a real protocol file isn't present in `assets/protocols`.

-# Browser Mode Connection Persistence Tests
-
-This document outlines the test plan for validating hardware connection persistence in Browser Mode.
-
-## 1. Current Behavior
-
-The `ExecutionService` manages the connection to the backend for protocol execution.
-
-- **Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend via a WebSocket connection for real-time updates on the execution status.
-- **State Management**: The service uses Angular Signals to maintain the execution state in memory. This includes the run ID, status, logs, and progress.
-- **Persistence**: The connection and execution state are **not** persisted across page refreshes. If the page is reloaded, the in-memory state is lost, and the WebSocket connection is terminated.
-- **Reconnection**: The WebSocket connection has a basic retry mechanism (`retry({ delay: 3000, count: 3 })`) that attempts to reconnect if the connection is lost during a run. However, this does not cover page reloads.
-
-## 2. Test Scenarios
-
-### 2.1. Test Connection State Across Page Refresh
-
-- **Objective**: Verify that the connection state is lost on page refresh.
-- **Preconditions**:
-    1. The application is running in Browser Mode.
-    2. A protocol run has been started and is in the `RUNNING` state.
-- **Steps**:
-    1. Observe the UI and confirm that the execution status, logs, and progress are being updated.
-    2. Refresh the browser page.
-- **Expected Outcome**:
-    - After the refresh, the UI should reset to its initial state.
-    - The application should not automatically reconnect to the ongoing run.
-    - The previous execution state (logs, progress) should be lost.
-
-### 2.2. Test Reconnection After Device Disconnect
-
-- **Objective**: Verify the WebSocket retry mechanism.
-- **Preconditions**:
-    1. The application is running in Browser Mode.
-    2. A protocol run has been started and is in the `RUNNING` state.
-- **Steps**:
-    1. Disconnect the network on the client machine to simulate a connection loss.
-    2. Observe the browser's developer console for WebSocket error messages.
-    3. Reconnect the network within the retry window (approximately 9 seconds).
-- **Expected Outcome**:
-    - The WebSocket should attempt to reconnect.
-    - Once the network is restored, the connection should be re-established, and the UI should resume receiving updates.
-
-### 2.3. Test Recovery After USB Errors
-
-- **Objective**: Document the application's behavior when the backend reports a hardware error.
-- **Preconditions**:
-    1. The application is running in Browser Mode.
-- **Steps**:
-    1. Manually send a WebSocket message of type `error` from the backend to the client.
-- **Expected Outcome**:
-    - The `ExecutionService` should handle the message and update the run state to `FAILED`.
-    - The UI should display an error message in the logs.
-    - The WebSocket connection should be terminated.
-
-## 3. Identified Gaps and Potential Improvements
-
-1.  **No State Persistence**: The most significant gap is the lack of state persistence across page reloads. This can lead to a poor user experience, as any page refresh will lose the context of the ongoing run.
-    - **Suggestion**: Use `localStorage` to store the `runId` of the active run. On application load, check for an active `runId` and, if one exists, automatically reconnect to the WebSocket to resume monitoring.
-2.  **No Manual Reconnect**: There is no UI mechanism to manually reconnect to a run.
-    - **Suggestion**: Add a "Reconnect to last run" button if a `runId` is found in `localStorage` but the WebSocket connection fails.
-3.  **Limited Error Recovery**: The frontend simply displays errors reported by the backend. There are no mechanisms for user-initiated recovery actions (e.g., "retry step," "ignore error").
-    - **Suggestion**: This is a larger feature, but worth noting. A more robust implementation might include a more sophisticated error handling and recovery workflow.

-### Security Issues
-
-The `npm audit` reported 8 vulnerabilities (2 low, 6 high). The high severity vulnerabilities are in `@angular/animations`, `@angular/cli`.
-
-### Unused Dependencies
-
-Based on a review of `package.json`, there are no obviously unused dependencies.
-
-## Python Dependencies
-
-### Security Issues
-
-The `uv pip audit` (via `pip-audit`) reported no known vulnerabilities.
-
-### Unused Dependencies
-
-A full dependency analysis was not performed, but a review of `pyproject.toml` did not reveal any obviously unused dependencies.
-
-## Build Issues
-
-The frontend build (`npm run build`) completed successfully but produced the following warning:
-- `bundle initial exceeded maximum budget. Budget 500.00 kB was not met by 261.15 kB with a total of 761.15 kB.`
-
-## Fix Priority
-
-1.  **High:** Address the high-severity security vulnerabilities in the frontend dependencies (`@angular/animations`, `@angular/cli`).
-2.  **Medium:** Update all outdated frontend dependencies to their latest versions.
-3.  **Low:** Investigate the bundle size warning and consider options for optimization.

-# Docs 404 Investigation
-
-## Problem Summary
-
-The application displays a "404 Not Found" Snackbar error when navigating to documentation pages like "Quickstart".
-
-**Error**: `Http failure response for /assets/docs/getting-started/quickstart-production.md: 404`
-
-## Root Cause
-
-1. **Speculative Loading**: `DocsPageComponent` defaults to `production` mode and attempts to load a mode-specific markdown file first (e.g., `quickstart-production.md`) before falling back to the generic file (`quickstart.md`).
-2. **Global Error Handling**: The `ErrorInterceptor` intercepts *all* HTTP errors, including these expected 404s from the speculative load. It displays a user-facing Snackbar notification immediately, regardless of whether the component handles the error later.
-3. **Missing Files**: Most documentation files do NOT have a `*-production.md` variant, making this 404 a common occurrence.
-
-## Affected Paths
-
-The following files are requested but rarely exist (only those marked `[EXISTS]` were found). All others trigger 404s.
-
-### Getting Started
-
-- `quickstart-production.md` (Missing)
-- `browser-mode-production.md` (Missing)
-- `browser-script-production.md` (Missing)
-- `installation-production.md` **[EXISTS]**
-
-### Architecture
-
-- `overview-production.md` **[EXISTS]**
-- `backend-production.md` **[EXISTS]**
-- `frontend-production.md` (Missing)
-- `execution-flow-production.md` (Missing)
-- `state-management-production.md` (Missing)
-- `simulation-production.md` (Missing)
-
-### User Guide, Development, Reference, API
-
-- All files in these sections generally lack a `-production.md` variant and trigger 404s.
-
-## Recommendations
-
-### Recommended Fix: HttpContext Suppression
-
-Instead of creating dozens of duplicate `*-production.md` files, we should modify the error handling logic to support "silent" 404s.
-
-1. **Update `ErrorInterceptor`**:
-    Add code to check for an `HttpContextToken` (e.g., `SKIP_ERROR_HANDLING`). If present, return the error to the caller without showing the Snackbar.
-
-    ```typescript
-    // core/http/http-context.tokens.ts
-    export const SKIP_ERROR_HANDLING = new HttpContextToken<boolean>(() => false);
-
-    // core/http/error.interceptor.ts
-    if (req.context.get(SKIP_ERROR_HANDLING)) {
-        return next(req);
-    }
-    ```
-
-2. **Update `DocsPageComponent`**:
-    Pass this context when making the speculative requests.
-
-    ```typescript
-    // features/docs/components/docs-page.component.ts
-    this.http.get(modePath, { 
-        responseType: 'text',
-        context: new HttpContext().set(SKIP_ERROR_HANDLING, true)
-    })
-    ```
-
-This approach maintains the useful mode-switching capability while eliminating the false-positive error notifications.

-# Browser Interrupt Logic Extraction (TD-801)
-
-## Overview
-
-This report documents the extraction of browser-side Python interruption logic from the `angular_refactor` branch diffs. The implementation enables graceful and immediate interruption of Python code executing via Pyodide in a Web Worker.
-
-## Core Components
-
-### 1. Python Worker (`python.worker.ts`)
-
-- **Pyodide Initialization**: Uses `loadPyodide` from the `pyodide` package.
-- **Interrupt Mechanism**:
-  - Uses a `SharedArrayBuffer` to communicate interrupts from the main thread.
-  - `const interruptBuffer = new Uint8Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(1));`
-  - `loadedPyodide.setInterruptBuffer(interruptBuffer);`
-  - Setting `interruptBuffer[0] = 2` triggers a `KeyboardInterrupt` in the Python runtime.
-- **Lifecycle**: Initializes Pyodide on load and handles `run` and `interrupt` message types.
-
-### 2. Python Runtime Service (`python-runtime.service.ts`)
-
-- **Worker Encapsulation**: Manages the `Worker` instance lifecycle (`new Worker(...)`, `terminate()`).
-- **Communication**:
-  - Exposes a `messages$` observable (via `Subject`) for the main thread to consume worker updates.
-  - `runCode(code)`: Sends a `{ type: 'run', payload: { code } }` message.
-  - `interrupt()`: Sends a `{ type: 'interrupt' }` message.
-- **Error Handling**: Captures `worker.onerror` and emits it through the message stream.
-
-### 3. Execution Service (`execution.service.ts`)
-
-- **Dual-Mode Execution**:
-  - Dispatches to either the backend API or the `PythonRuntimeService` based on the environment/mode.
-  - **Run ID**: Browser runs are prefixed with `browser-` (e.g., `browser-170123...`).
-- **Status Mapping**:
-  - Maps Pyodide-specific statuses to the application's `ExecutionStatus`:
-    - `loading-pyodide` -> `PREPARING`
-    - `pyodide-ready` -> `PENDING`
-    - `executing-python` -> `RUNNING`
-    - `python-execution-complete` -> `COMPLETED`
-    - `python-execution-interrupted` -> `CANCELLED`
-- **Interrupt Logic**:
-  - In `stopRun()`, it checks `runId.startsWith('browser-')`.
-  - If true, calls `this.pythonRuntimeService.interrupt()`.
-
-## Interrupt Handling Patterns
-
-1. **Shared Buffer Pre-emption**: The `SharedArrayBuffer` allows the main thread to flip a bit that the Pyodide runtime checks between bytecodes, ensuring the worker doesn't need to be terminated (preserving state).
-2. **Reactive Message Loop**: The `ExecutionService` acts as a bridge, subscribing to worker messages and updating its internal `_currentRun` signal.
-3. **Graceful Cleanup**: The `clearRun()` method triggers an `ngUnsubscribe` subject to clean up observables and calls `disconnect()`.
-

-# Extracted Geometry Heuristics Code (TD-702)
-
-This report documents the extracted geometry heuristics implementation and fixes from Jules session `16235462376134233538` (Fix Geometry Heuristics in web_bridge.py).
-
-## 1. Implementation Details
-
-The implementation enhances `read_plate_data_visualization` in `praxis/backend/services/plate_viz.py` to dynamically determine plate geometry based on the associated resource definition.
-
-### Changes to `praxis/backend/services/plate_viz.py`
-
-```python
-# Added import
-from praxis.backend.services.resource import resource_service
-
-# Enhanced plate layout detection logic
-async def read_plate_data_visualization(
-    db: AsyncSession,
-    plate_resource_accession_id: uuid.UUID,
-    data_type: DataOutputTypeEnum,
-) -> Optional[PlateDataVisualization]:
-    # ... (existing data fetching) ...
-
-    # Get plate information
-    resource = await resource_service.get(db, plate_resource_accession_id)
-    plate_layout = {"rows": 8, "columns": 12, "total_wells": 96, "format": "96-well"}
-    
-    if resource and resource.resource_definition and resource.resource_definition.definition:
-        try:
-            # Safely extract dimensions from resource definition
-            definition = resource.resource_definition.definition
-            num_items_x = definition.get("num_items_x")
-            num_items_y = definition.get("num_items_y")
-            
-            if num_items_x and num_items_y:
-                plate_layout = {
-                    "rows": num_items_y,
-                    "columns": num_items_x,
-                    "total_wells": num_items_x * num_items_y,
-                    "format": f"{num_items_x * num_items_y}-well",
-                }
-        except (AttributeError, KeyError) as e:
-            logger.warning(
-                "Could not parse plate geometry from resource definition for plate "
-                f"{plate_resource_accession_id}. Error: {e}",
-            )
-    
-    # ... (rest of the function) ...
-```
-
-## 2. Test Verification
-
-Added comprehensive test coverage in `tests/services/test_plate_viz.py` to verify the new logic.
-
-### New Test Cases
-
-- **Case 1**: Plate with defined geometry (e.g., 384-well, 24x16).
-- **Case 2**: Plate with no definition (fallback to 96-well).
-
-```python
-@pytest.mark.asyncio
-@patch("praxis.backend.services.plate_viz.resource_service", new_callable=AsyncMock)
-async def test_read_plate_data_visualization_with_geometry(
-    mock_resource_service: AsyncMock,
-    mock_db_session: AsyncMock,
-) -> None:
-    # (Setup mock data and relationships)
-    
-    # Case 1: Plate with defined geometry (384-well)
-    resource_def_384 = ResourceDefinitionOrm(
-        definition={"num_items_x": 24, "num_items_y": 16},
-    )
-    # ...
-    assert result_384.plate_layout["rows"] == 16
-    assert result_384.plate_layout["columns"] == 24
-    assert result_384.plate_layout["format"] == "384-well"
-
-    # Case 2: Fallback
-    # ...
-    assert result_96.plate_layout["format"] == "96-well"
-```
-
-## 3. Key Findings
-
-- **Safe Parsing**: Uses `.get()` on the definition dictionary to avoid `KeyError` on non-standard labware definitions.
-- **Improved Fallback**: Decouples visualization from a hardcoded 96-well format, allowing the system to handle 384-well and bespoke formats if they are defined in the metadata.
-- **Service Dependency**: Introducing `resource_service` into `plate_viz` adds a dependency but correctly centralizes the "truth" about labware geometry.

-# Backend Machine Registration Work Extraction Report
-
-**Task ID**: TD-1201
-**Source Session**: 7588975548984364060
-**Date**: 2026-01-21
-
-## Summary
-
-This report documents the extraction of Backend Machine Registration work from Jules session `7588975548984364060`. The work includes database schema enhancements for versioning, new test infrastructure for hardware APIs, and E2E test cases for machine registration.
-
-## Database Schema Changes
-
-### PLRTypeDefinitionOrm (`praxis/backend/models/orm/plr_sync.py`)
-
-The base class for PyLabRobot type definitions was updated to support versioning.
-
-- Added `version` column: `Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String, nullable=False, default="0.0.0")`.
-- Purpose: Allows tracking and matching specific versions of hardware definitions during registration.
-
-### Base ORM Class (`praxis/backend/utils/db.py`)
-
-- Refactored `Base` class to ensure `name` is a primary identified column across all models.
-
-## API Endpoint: Machine Registration
-
-### Endpoint Specification (Inferred from Tests)
-
-- **Route**: `POST /hardware/register` (Expected prefix: `/api/v1/hardware`)
-- **Payload Schema**:
-
-  ```json
-  {
-    "name": "string",
-    "serial_number": "string",
-    "machine_type_definition_name": "string",
-    "connection_info": {
-      "backend": "string",
-      "...": "..."
-    }
-  }
-  ```
-
-- **Responses**:
-  - `200 OK`: Returns the registered machine object.
-  - `409 Conflict`: Returned if a machine with the same serial number is already registered.
-
-### Implementation Status
-
-The registration logic integration in `MachineService` and the actual endpoint implementation in `hardware.py` were referenced in tests but were mostly placeholders in the current disk state. The logic is expected to involve:
-
-1. Looking up `MachineDefinitionOrm` by name.
-2. Creating a new `MachineOrm` record.
-3. Persisting connection information.
-
-## Test Infrastructure
-
-### New API Test Suite (`praxis/backend/tests/api/`)
-
-- `conftest.py`: Established standard `httpx.AsyncClient` fixtures for testing the FastAPI application.
-- `test_hardware.py`: Implemented functional tests for the registration flow:
-  - `test_register_machine`: Verifies successful creation and duplicate prevention.
-
-### Test Factories (`tests/factories.py`)
-
-- `MachineDefinitionFactory`: Added to support creation of machine type metadata in tests.
-  - Fields: `name`, `fqn`, `version`.
-- `MachineFactory`: Updated to support the new ORM structure.
-
-## Models and Schemas
-
-- **MachineDefinitionOrm**: Catalogs machine types with versioning.
-- **MachineOrm**: Tracks physical device instances tied to definitions.
-- **MachineCreate/RegisterRequest**: Pydantic models for validated registration input.
-
-## Missing/Incomplete Items
-
-- Full logic implementation in `MachineService` (currently placeholder on disk).
-- Migration scripts for the new `version` column in `PLRTypeDefinitionOrm`.

-# PLR Category Architecture Audit - Extraction Report
-
-## Summary
-
-The session focused on implementing a standardized filtering mechanism for PyLabRobot (PLR) categories across the backend and frontend. This enables more granular discovery of resources (e.g., plates, tip racks) in the Asset Management system.
-
-## Extracted Findings & Improvements
-
-### 1. Backend: Standardized Filtering
-
-- **Model Enhancements**: Added `plr_category` field to `SearchFilters` in `praxis/backend/models/pydantic_internals/filters.py`.
-- **Query Builder**: Implemented `apply_plr_category_filter` in `praxis/backend/services/utils/query_builder.py` and integrated it into the main `apply_search_filters` pipeline.
-- **Deduplication**: Cleaned up `CRUDBase.get_multi` in `praxis/backend/services/utils/crud_base.py` by removing redundant hand-coded filter application logic in favor of the centralized `apply_search_filters`.
-
-### 2. Frontend: Dynamic Filtering UI
-
-- **Component Update**: Added a "Category" dropdown to `ResourceDialogComponent` (`praxis/web-client/src/app/features/assets/components/resource-dialog.component.ts`).
-- **Reactive Updates**: Implemented `onCategoryChange` to trigger a re-fetch of resource definitions whenever the category selection changes.
-- **Service Integration**: Updated `AssetService.getResourceDefinitions` to support the optional `plrCategory` parameter using `HttpParams`.
-
-### 3. Verification
-
-- **New Tests**: Created `praxis/backend/tests/api/test_resource_filtering.py` to verify:
-  - Filtering resource definitions by `plate`.
-  - Filtering resource definitions by `tip_rack`.
-  - Default behavior when no filter is provided.
-
-## Architectural Recommendations for Future Work
-
-- **Consistency**: Ensure all ORM models for resources (Machines, Labware, etc.) implement the `plr_category` attribute to fully utilize the new filter.
-- **Expansion**: Consider adding more standard PLR categories (e.g., `shaker`, `heater`, `pump`) to the `mat-select` options in the frontend as they are added to the system.
-- **Dynamic Options**: Ideally, the list of categories should be fetched from an endpoint rather than hardcoded in the template.
-
-## ⚠️ Path Discrepancies
-
-During extraction, several discrepancies between the session diff and the current codebase were noted:
-
-- **Filters Model**: The diff references `praxis/backend/models/pydantic_internals/filters.py`, but the current location is `praxis/backend/models/domain/filters.py`.
-- **ORM Models**: The diff uses `praxis.backend.models.orm.resource`, but the classes are actually in `praxis.backend.models.domain.resource`.
-- **Integration**: While the diff simplifies `CRUDBase.get_multi`, the changes should be applied to the correct paths in `praxis/backend/services/utils/crud_base.py`.

-# Research Report: Frontend and Backend Type Architecture
-
-## Overview
-
-This report documents the architectural relationship between **Frontend Types** and **Backend Types** for machines and resources in the Praxis codebase, specifically within the Browser-Mode (SQLite-driven) context. It identifies critical "leaks" where technical backend details are exposed to the user and provides a refactoring roadmap for v0.1-Alpha.
-
-## Architectural Distinction
-
-The Praxis architecture follows a three-tier hierarchy to decouple protocol requirements from physical hardware and simulation drivers.
-
-| Tier | Component | Example | Responsibility |
-|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
-| **Tier 1** | **Frontend Type** | `LiquidHandler`, `PlateReader` | The abstract category required by Protocols. Defined in `machine_frontend_definitions`. |
-| **Tier 2** | **Machine Definition** | `Hamilton STAR`, `Opentrons OT-2` | The user-selectable "Template" or "Model". It bridges the Frontend to specific capabilities. Defined in `machine_definitions`. |
-| **Tier 3** | **Backend Driver** | `HamiltonBackend`, `ChatterboxBackend` | The technical implementation that communicates with hardware or simulation buffers. Defined in `machine_backend_definitions`. |
-
-### Data Model Diagram (Logical)

-

-```
-
----
-
-## Current State Analysis
-
-### 1. Data Source Overlap
-
-In `praxis/web-client/src/assets/browser-data/plr-definitions.ts`, the `PLR_MACHINE_DEFINITIONS` array is overloaded. It contains:
-
-- **Simulated Frontends**: (e.g., `Simulated Liquid Handler`) which act as generic templates for simulation.
-- **Specific Hardware Models**: (e.g., `STAR`) which effectively act as backends but are presented as definitions.
-
-### 2. Implementation "Leaks"
-
-Several places in the UI incorrectly expose Tier 3 (Backend) details directly to the user:
-
-#### A. Technical FQNs in Simulation Config
-
-In `src/app/features/run-protocol/components/simulation-config-dialog/`, the user is presented with a dropdown of "Simulation Backends". These are populated directly from `available_simulation_backends` in `machine_definitions`, which currently contains raw Python FQNs:
-
-- `pylabrobot.liquid_handling.backends.ChatterboxBackend`
-- `pylabrobot.liquid_handling.backends.LiquidHandlerChatterboxBackend`
-
-**Leak**: Users should see "Chatterbox" or "Visual Simulator", not Python module paths.
-
-#### B. Mixed Machine Definitions in Asset Wizard
-
-The `AssetWizard` filters machine definitions using `plr_category === 'Machine'`. Since both specific hardware models and generic simulated frontends share this category, the search results are a mix of technical implementations and user-friendly templates.
-
-#### C. Database Table Overloading
-
-The `machine_definitions` table in SQLite is being used as a catch-all for anything that is "selectable", bypassing the stricter `machine_frontend_definitions` vs `machine_backend_definitions` separation in some lookup logic.
-
----
-
-## Recommended Refactoring Approach
-
-### Phase 1: Clean Up User Exposure (High Priority)
-
-1. **Friendly Names for Backends**: Add a `display_name` field to simulation backends or create a mapping utility in the UI to transform FQNs.
-2. **Metadata-Driven UI**: Modify `SimulationConfigDialogComponent` to fetch human-readable labels from `machine_backend_definitions` instead of using raw strings from the machine definition.
-
-### Phase 2: Structural Decoupling
-
-1. **Strict Table Roles**:
-    - `machine_frontend_definitions`: ONLY base categories (LiquidHandler, PlateReader).
-    - `machine_definitions`: User-facing models (Hamilton STAR, Simulated LH).
-    - `machine_backend_definitions`: Technical drivers (Hardware & Simulators).
-2. **Discriminator Refinement**: Transition from the overloaded `plr_category` to a more specific `definition_type` (e.g., `TEMPLATE`, `HARDWARE_MODEL`, `VIRTUAL`).
-
-### Phase 3: Protocol Compatibility Logic
-
-Refactor `ExecutionService.getCompatibility()` to:
-
-1. Identify the **Frontend Type** required by the protocol.
-2. List all **Machine Definitions** compatible with that Frontend.
-3. If an asset is a "Simulated Frontend", trigger the `SimulationConfigDialog` to bind a compatible **Backend**.
-
-## Priority-Ordered Fix List
-
-1. [ ] Map FQNs to friendly names in `simulation-config-dialog.component.ts`.
-2. [ ] Update `plr-definitions.ts` to include `compatible_backends` metadata for all machine definitions.
-3. [ ] Filter `AssetWizard` search results based on a "User Facing" flag instead of `plr_category === 'Machine'`.
-4. [ ] Standardize `machine_category` (Frontend) vs `machine_type` (Definition) naming in `asset.models.ts`.

-# Inventory Search Logic Investigation - Root Cause Analysis
-
-## Executive Summary
-
-The "No definitions matching search" error in the Playground inventory adder is caused by a logic error in `AssetWizard`, which attempts to filter machine definitions using a non-existent property (`plr_category`). The data exists in the SQLite database but is filtered out by the UI component.
-
-## Data Verification
-
-- **Seed Data**: Confirmed presence of ~79 definitions in `plr-definitions.ts`.
-- **Seeding Logic**: `SqliteService.initDb()` performs `INSERT OR IGNORE` from these definitions.
-- **Data Shape**:
-  - `PLR_MACHINE_DEFINITIONS` uses `machine_type` (e.g., 'LiquidHandler').
-  - `SqliteService` maps this to `machine_category` column.
-  - `MachineDefinition` interface has optional `plr_category` and `machine_category`.
-  - In Browser Mode, objects returned by `AssetService` will have `machine_category` populated, but `plr_category` is **undefined**.
-
-## Root Cause
-
-In `AssetWizard.ngOnInit` (Line 123):
-
-```typescript
-// Faulty Logic
-return this.assetService.searchMachineDefinitions(query).pipe(
-  map(defs => defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === 'Machine')) 
-);
-```
-
-1. **Property Mismatch**: `d.plr_category` is undefined for machine definitions.
-2. **Incorrect Value**: Even if it existed, valid categories are 'LiquidHandler', 'PlateReader', etc., not 'Machine'.
-3. **Filter Ignoring User Selection**: The logic hardcodes the check, ignoring the user's selected category dropdown.
-
-## Recommended Fix
-
-Update `AssetWizard` to filter by the selected `machine_category` instead of the hardcoded `plr_category === 'Machine'`.
-
-**File**: `praxis/web-client/src/app/shared/components/asset-wizard/asset-wizard.ts`
-
-```typescript
-// Corrected Logic
-return this.assetService.searchMachineDefinitions(query).pipe(
-  map(defs => defs.filter(d => !category || d.machine_category === category))
-);
-```
-
-This change will:
-
-1. Respect the user's category selection (e.g., "LiquidHandler").
-2. correctly match against the populated `machine_category` property.
-3. Allow search results to appear.

-# Inventory Wizard Redesign Spec
-
-## Component Hierarchy
-
-- **`AppAssetWizard`** (Main Container, Helper Dialog)
-  - **`WizardHeader`** (Title, Close Button, Progress Indicator)
-  - **`CategorySelectionStep`** (Step 1)
-    - `CategoryCard` (Grid Item)
-  - **`DefinitionBrowserStep`** (Step 2)
-    - `SearchToolbar` (Search Input + Filter Chips)
-    - `DefinitionGrid` (Responsive Grid)
-      - `DefinitionCard` (Thumbnail, Title, Metadata)
-    - `DefinitionEmptyState` (Create Simulation CTA)
-  - **`ConfigurationStep`** (Step 3)
-    - `ConfigurationForm` (Dynamic fields based on type)
-  - **`ReviewStep`** (Step 4)
-    - `AssetSummaryCard`
-
-## Screen 1: Category Selection (Step 1)
-
-**Visual Strategy:** A visually rich entry point that categorizes assets clearly. Using large, touch-friendly cards with icons and descriptions to guide the user (especially helpful for new users distinguishing between 'Machine' and 'Resource').
-
-**Layout:**
-
-- **Grid:** CSS Grid with `auto-fill` (min-width: 240px).
-  - **Mobile:** 1 Column
-  - **Tablet:** 2 Columns
-  - **Desktop:** 3-4 Columns
-- **Cards:**
-  - **Machine:** Icon: `precision_manufacturing` or `smart_toy`
-    - Label: "Machine"
-    - Desc: "Liquid handlers, plate readers, centrifuges."
-  - **Resource:** Icon: `science` or `inventory_2`
-    - Label: "Resource"
-    - Desc: "Labware, plates, tips, tubes."
-- **Interaction:**
-  - Cards have hover intent (elevation lift + border highlight).
-  - Single click selects and auto-advances or reveals sub-category selection below (if expanded).
-- **Sub-Category Selector:**
-  - A visible list of chips (e.g., "Liquid Handler", "Plate Reader") appears when a Type is selected, allowing refinement *before* the next step.
-
-## Screen 2: Definition Browser (Step 2)
-
-**Visual Strategy:** A marketplace-like browsing experience. Focus on discoverability.
-
-**Layout & Interactions:**
-
-- **Search Bar:** Sticky top bar.
-  - Full-width `mat-form-field` with "search" icon prefix.
-  - **Autocomplete:** Suggestions based on vendor or common names.
-- **Filter Bar:** Horizontal scrollable row of `mat-chip-listbox`.
-  - Chips: `Simulated Only`, `Vendor: Hamilton`, `Type: 96-Well`, `Type: 384-Well`.
-- **Definition Grid:**
-  - **Card Design:**
-    - **Asset Thumbnail:** (Placeholder or generated icon based on geometry).
-    - **Header:** Definition Name (Bold), Vendor (Subtitle).
-    - **Badge:** `Simulated` (Green), `Hardware` (Blue).
-    - **Footer:** Dimensions (X/Y/Z) or Volume (µL).
-  - **Empty State:**
-    - Illustration (SVG).
-    - Text: "No matching definitions found."
-    - **CTA:** Primary Button "Create Custom Definition" (Triggers new side-dialog).
-    - Secondary Link: "Import from PLR Library".
-
-## Component Details
-
-### `CategoryCard`
-
-- **Props:** `icon: string`, `title: string`, `description: string`, `selected: boolean`
-- **Styling:**
-  - Border: 1px solid `var(--mat-sys-outline-variant)`
-  - Background: `var(--mat-sys-surface-container-low)`
-  - Selected State: Border `primary`, Background `primary-container` (low opacity).
-
-### `DefinitionCard`
-
-- **Props:** `definition: MachineDefinition | ResourceDefinition`
-- **Dimensions:** Fixed height (~180px) to ensure uniform grid.
-- **Content:**
-  - Uses `text-overflow: ellipsis` for long names.
-  - Vendor logo (if available) or text fallback.
-
-## Animation & Transitions
-
-- **Step Transition:** Slide-over effect (Material standard) or cross-fade.
-- **Card Hover:** `transform: translateY(-2px); box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-elevation-level2); transition: all 0.2s ease-out;`
-- **Selection:** Ripple effect on click.
-
-## Theme Integration
-
-- Uses standard Material Design 3 tokens:
-  - Surface: `--mat-sys-surface`, `--mat-sys-surface-container`
-  - On-Surface: `--mat-sys-on-surface`
-  - Primary: `--mat-sys-primary`

-# Recon Report: Inventory Wizard Analysis
-
-**Date**: 2026-01-21
-**Target**: Asset Wizard (Inventory Creation)
-**Component**: `AssetWizard`
-**Location**: `src/app/shared/components/asset-wizard/`
-
-## 1. Component Identification
-
-The "Add Inventory Wizard" corresponds to the `AssetWizard` component.
-
-- **Controller**: `asset-wizard.ts`
-- **Template**: `asset-wizard.html`
-- **Styles**: `asset-wizard.scss`
-- **Trigger**: `PlaygroundComponent` -> `openInventory()` -> `MatDialog.open(AssetWizard)`
-
-## 2. Current Implementation Logic
-
-The wizard is implemented as a **Linear Stepper** (`MatStepper`) with 4 steps:
-
-1. **Type & Category**: Selects 'MACHINE' vs 'RESOURCE' and sub-category. Driven by `typeStepFormGroup`.
-2. **Definition**: Searchable list of `MachineDefinition` or `ResourceDefinition`. Uses `AssetService.search*` methods.
-3. **Configuration**: Instance configuration (Name, Backend/Driver, Connection Info). Context-aware (hides backend for Resources, handles simulated backends).
-4. **Review**: Summary screen and final `createAsset()` call.
-
-## 3. Critical Findings: Why it is "UGLY"
-
-The visual inspection helps confirm significant missing styles. The HTML structure implies a sophisticated layout that is **completely unimplemented** in the CSS.
-
-### A. Missing CSS Patterns (The "Ghost" Classes)
-
-The HTML relies on numerous classes that **do not exist** in the `asset-wizard.scss` or global search. These elements are effectively unstyled `<div>`s:
-
-- `.asset-wizard-container` (No layout container)
-- `.step-content` (No padding/spacing)
-- `.type-selection`, `.type-card` (Intended as cards/grid, rendering as plain stacked blocks)
-- `.category-selection`
-- `.step-actions` (Buttons likely jammed together or default aligned)
-- `.search-container`
-- `.results-grid`, `.result-card` (Search results likely render as a plain vertical list with no card styling)
-- `.form-grid`
-
-### B. Design System Violations
-
-- **Hardcoded Colors**: The few styles that *do* exist (for `.review-card`) use hardcoded hex values:
-  - `#fafafa` (Background)
-  - `#eee` (Borders)
-  - `#666`, `#333`, `#3f51b5` (Text/Primary)
-- **No Design Tokens**: The component completely ignores the `var(--mat-sys-...)` token system used elsewhere in the application, making it incompatible with Dark Mode and theming.
-- **Typography**: No use of typography mixins or classes.
-
-### C. UI/UX Gaps
-
-- **Responsive Layout**: Without the grid CSS, the "cards" for type selection and search results do not reflow.
-- **Interactive States**: No hover effects or selection states defined for `.type-card` or `.result-card`.
-- **Feedback**: The "Loading" state is implemented but uses a simple spinner with hardcoded `#3f51b5` text.
-
-## 4. Recommendations for Designer Task
-
-A complete redesign is required. The logic is functional (Angular Reactive Forms + Stepper), but the View Layer is incomplete.
-
-**Action Plan:**
-
-1. **Implement Layout CSS**: Create proper Flex/Grid layouts for `.type-selection` and `.results-grid`.
-2. **Tokenize Colors**: Replace all hex codes with `var(--mat-sys-surface-container)`, `var(--mat-sys-on-surface)`, etc.
-3. **Card Components**: Style `.type-card` and `.result-card` to look like interactive, selectable elements (elevation, border, hover states).
-4. **Standardize Spacing**: Use standard spacing variables instead of `20px`/`12px`.

-# Investigation Report: Selective Transfer Parameter Persistence
-
-**Date**: 2026-01-21  
-**Task ID**: 260121185700  
-**Persona**: Oracle  
-
-## Executive Summary
-
-The investigation confirms that the `transfer_pattern` and `replicate_count` parameters **DO NOT** exist in the current codebase or the generated database file on disk. Their appearance in the application is identified as a **client-side caching artifact** caused by `SqliteService` prioritizing stale IndexedDB data over the fresh `praxis.db` file.
-
-## Findings
-
-### 1. Codebase Audit (Passed)
-
-- **Source File**: `praxis/protocol/protocols/selective_transfer.py` was inspected.
-- **Parameters Found**: `liquid_handler`, `source_plate`, `dest_plate`, `tip_rack`, `indices`, `transfer_volume_ul`, `state`.
-- **Result**: `transfer_pattern` and `replicate_count` are **NOT** present in the source code.
-
-### 2. Database Audit (Passed)
-
-- **Database File**: `praxis/web-client/src/assets/db/praxis.db` (Generated 2026-01-21 18:31).
-- **Table**: `parameter_definitions` queried for "Selective Transfer" protocol.
-- **Result**: Only `indices` and `transfer_volume_ul` (plus system params) were found. The unwanted parameters are **ABSENT** from the disk database.
-
-### 3. Root Cause Analysis: Frontend Persistence
-
-- **Component**: `SqliteService` (`praxis/web-client/src/app/core/services/sqlite.service.ts`)
-- **Mechanism**: The service attempts to load a persisted database from specific browser storage (IndexedDB) *before* falling back to the `praxis.db` file on disk.
-- **Validation Gap**: The service currently only validates that the `machine_definitions` table exists. It **does not** verify if the persisted schema version or generation timestamp matches the file on server.
-- **Outcome**: A browser that previously loaded the old schema will continue to use it, ignoring the new clean database generated on the backend.
-
-## Recommendations
-
-### Immediate Workaround (For User)
-
-Force a database reset in the browser to clear the stale cache:
-
-1. Append `?resetdb=1` to the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4200/?resetdb=1`).
-2. Refresh the page.
-3. This triggers `SqliteService.clearStore()` and reloads fresh definitions from disk.
-
-### Systemic Fix (For Engineering)
-
-Update `SqliteService` to perform a robust freshness check:
-
-1. Fetch `praxis.db` headers or a separate `metadata.json` first.
-2. Compare a version/timestamp token against the persisted `_schema_metadata`.
-3. If the server version is newer, auto-trigger `clearStore()`.
-
-## Conclusion
-
-The "regression" is a local environment state issue, not a codebase defect. No code changes are required in `selective_transfer.py` or `.agent` files. The fix is operational (browser cache clear).

-# Recon Report: pylabrobot.io Transport Audit for Browser Mode
-
-**Target:** pylabrobot.io transport abstraction layer
-**Priority:** P1
-**Auditor:** antigravity (recon persona)
-**Date:** 2026-01-22
-
----
-
-## 1. IO Transport Types Discovery
-
-The `pylabrobot.io` module provides several transport abstractions for hardware communication. Below is a list of all identified types and their current support status in the browser (Pyodide) environment.
-
-| Transport Type | Python Module | Native Library Dependency | Status |
-| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
-| **Serial** | `pylabrobot.io.serial` | `pyserial` | ✅ Shimmed |
-| **USB** | `pylabrobot.io.usb` | `pyusb` (libusb) | ✅ Shimmed |
-| **FTDI** | `pylabrobot.io.ftdi` | `pylibftdi` (libftdi) | ✅ Shimmed |
-| **HID** | `pylabrobot.io.hid` | `hid` (hidapi) | ❌ **NOT SHIMMED** |
-| **Socket** | `pylabrobot.io.socket` | `asyncio` streams (raw TCP) | ❌ **NOT SHIMMED** |
-| **HTTP** | `pylabrobot...backends.http` | `requests` | ❌ **NOT SHIMMED*** |
-
-*\*Note: `HTTP` is partially functional via environment-level patches like `pyodide-http`, but lacks a formal `pylabrobot.io` implementation.*
-
----
-
-## 2. Browser Shim Inventory
-
-### ✅ Existing Shims (`praxis/web-client/src/assets/shims/`)
-
-1. **`web_serial_shim.py`**: Implements `WebSerial` using the browser's WebSerial API. Supports both dynamic `requestPort` and `SerialProxy` for main-thread delegation.
-2. **`web_usb_shim.py`**: Implements `WebUSB` using the browser's WebUSB API.
-3. **`web_ftdi_shim.py`**: Implements `WebFTDI`. Critical for CLARIOstar support.
-
-### ❌ Missing Shims
-
-1. **HID Shim**: Required for **Inheco** heating/shaking devices.
-2. **Socket Shim**: Required for **PreciseFlex** robot arms and **Inheco SiLA** interfaces.
-
----
-
-## 3. Risk Assessment & Recommendations
-
-### 🔴 High Risk: HID Devices (Inheco)
-
-- **Impact**: Inheco temperature controllers are industry standard. Currently, they cannot be controlled in browser mode.
-- **Recommendation**: Develop a `WebHID` shim. The WebHID API is compatible with the `hidapi` model used by PyLabRobot.
-
-### 🔴 High Risk: Socket/TCP Limitations
-
-- **Impact**: PreciseFlex arms and other ethernet-enabled devices are hard-blocked by browser security models which prevent raw TCP connections.
-- **Recommendation**: This is a structural limitation. Short-term fix is to use a WebSocket-to-TCP proxy server (e.g., `websockify`) if local hardware access is required, or accept that these backends require a "bridged" execution mode.
-
-### 🟠 Moderate Risk: Direct Imports Bypass
-
-- **Finding**: Several backends (`BioShake`, `MasterFlex`, `Cytomat`) bypass `pylabrobot.io` and perform `import serial` directly.
-- **Impact**: These backends will fail to load in Pyodide even if `pylabrobot.io.Serial` is patched.
-- **Recommendation**: The `pyodide_io_patch.py` should be expanded to shim `sys.modules['serial']`, `sys.modules['usb']`, and `sys.modules['hid']` entirely, rather than just patching the `pylabrobot.io` namespace.
-
-### 🟡 Low Risk: Missing Constants
-
-- **Finding**: Some backends rely on constants from the `serial` module (e.g., `serial.EIGHTBITS`). Existing shims do not provide these.
-- **Recommendation**: Ensure shims include standard `pyserial` and `pyusb` constant definitions to avoid `AttributeError`.
-
----
-
-## 4. Proposed Action Plan
-
-1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Update `pyodide_io_patch.py` to inject shims into `sys.modules` to catch direct imports.
-2. **Phase 2**: Implement `web_hid_shim.py` to enable Inheco device support.
-3. **Phase 3**: Evaluate a WebSocket-to-TCP bridge for `Socket` transport support.

-+# Maintenance Audit Prompt
-+
-+## Usage
-+Run this prompt periodically to maintain `.agents/` health. This prompt guides you through a series of checks to identify and resolve common maintenance issues.
-+
-+## Steps
-+
-+### 1. Check for Stale Files
-+- **Goal**: Identify and archive files that haven't been modified in the last 30 days.
-+- **Action**: Run the following command to find files older than 30 days:
-+  ```bash
-+  find .agents -type f -mtime +30
-+  ```
-+- **Recommendation**: For each file identified, evaluate if it's still relevant. If not, move it to the `.agents/archive` directory.
-+
-+### 2. Review Archive Directory
-+- **Goal**: Ensure the `.agents/archive` directory doesn't contain anything that should be active or that can be deleted.
-+- **Action**: List the contents of the archive:
-+  ```bash
-+  ls -l .agents/archive
-+  ```
-+- **Recommendation**: Review the archived files. Delete anything that is no longer needed. If a file is still relevant, consider moving it back to an active directory.
-+
-+### 3. Scan for TODO/FIXME Comments
-+- **Goal**: Find and address any outstanding action items or fixes noted in the codebase.
-+- **Action**: Use `grep` to search for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments within the `.agents/` directory:
-+  ```bash
-+  grep -r "TODO" .agents/
-+  grep -r "FIXME" .agents/
-+  ```
-+- **Recommendation**: For each comment found, create a task or address the issue directly.
-+
-+### 4. Identify Orphaned Artifacts
-+- **Goal**: Find any artifacts (e.g., old reports, temporary files) that are no longer associated with any active tasks or prompts.
-+- **Action**: Manually review the contents of the `.agents/` directory, looking for files that don't seem to have a purpose.
-+- **Recommendation**: If you find any orphaned files, either archive or delete them.
-+
-+### 5. Suggest Maintenance Actions
-+- **Goal**: Based on the audit, suggest a set of maintenance actions.
-+- **Action**: Review the findings from the previous steps.
-+- **Recommendation**: Create a summary of the necessary actions, such as:
-+  - "Archive the following files: [list of files]"
-+  - "Delete the following files from the archive: [list of files]"
-+  - "Address the following TODO/FIXME comments: [list of comments]"
-+  - "Remove the following orphaned artifacts: [list of artifacts]"

-+# Standardized Tracers for Linked Indices
-+
-+## Objective
-+
-+Validate linked indices (source and destination well alignment) in protocols.
-+
-+## Tracer Implementation
-+
-+A new `LinkedIndicesTracer` class has been created in `praxis/backend/tracers.py`. This class is responsible for tracking and validating linked indices. It has a `validate` method that takes source and destination well sets and returns `True` if they are valid, `False` otherwise.
-+
-+## Integration Points
-+
-+The `_execute_protocol_main_logic` method in `praxis/backend/core/orchestrator/execution.py` has been modified to use the `LinkedIndicesTracer`. Before executing the protocol, this method checks if the `requires_linked_indices` flag is set on the protocol definition. If it is, it uses the `LinkedIndicesTracer` to validate the source and destination well sets.
-+
-+## Error Handling
-+
-+A new `InvalidWellSetsError` exception has been added to `praxis/backend/utils/errors.py`. This exception is raised by the `LinkedIndicesTracer` if the well sets are invalid. The `_handle_protocol_execution_error` method in `praxis/backend/core/orchestrator/error_handling.py` has been modified to handle the `InvalidWellSetsError` exception. This method catches the exception and returns a user-friendly error message.
-+
-+## UI Feedback
-+
-+When an `InvalidWellSetsError` is caught, the protocol run is marked as `FAILED` and an error message is returned to the user. The error message includes the reason for the failure, e.g., "Source and destination well sets have different lengths."

-+# Browser Mode Connection Persistence Tests
-+
-+This document outlines the test plan for validating hardware connection persistence in Browser Mode.
-+
-+## 1. Current Behavior
-+
-+The `ExecutionService` manages the connection to the backend for protocol execution.
-+
-+- **Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend via a WebSocket connection for real-time updates on the execution status.
-+- **State Management**: The service uses Angular Signals to maintain the execution state in memory. This includes the run ID, status, logs, and progress.
-+- **Persistence**: The connection and execution state are **not** persisted across page refreshes. If the page is reloaded, the in-memory state is lost, and the WebSocket connection is terminated.
-+- **Reconnection**: The WebSocket connection has a basic retry mechanism (`retry({ delay: 3000, count: 3 })`) that attempts to reconnect if the connection is lost during a run. However, this does not cover page reloads.
-+
-+## 2. Test Scenarios
-+
-+### 2.1. Test Connection State Across Page Refresh
-+
-+- **Objective**: Verify that the connection state is lost on page refresh.
-+- **Preconditions**:
-+    1. The application is running in Browser Mode.
-+    2. A protocol run has been started and is in the `RUNNING` state.
-+- **Steps**:
-+    1. Observe the UI and confirm that the execution status, logs, and progress are being updated.
-+    2. Refresh the browser page.
-+- **Expected Outcome**:
-+    - After the refresh, the UI should reset to its initial state.
-+    - The application should not automatically reconnect to the ongoing run.
-+    - The previous execution state (logs, progress) should be lost.
-+
-+### 2.2. Test Reconnection After Device Disconnect
-+
-+- **Objective**: Verify the WebSocket retry mechanism.
-+- **Preconditions**:
-+    1. The application is running in Browser Mode.
-+    2. A protocol run has been started and is in the `RUNNING` state.
-+- **Steps**:
-+    1. Disconnect the network on the client machine to simulate a connection loss.
-+    2. Observe the browser's developer console for WebSocket error messages.
-+    3. Reconnect the network within the retry window (approximately 9 seconds).
-+- **Expected Outcome**:
-+    - The WebSocket should attempt to reconnect.
-+    - Once the network is restored, the connection should be re-established, and the UI should resume receiving updates.
-+
-+### 2.3. Test Recovery After USB Errors
-+
-+- **Objective**: Document the application's behavior when the backend reports a hardware error.
-+- **Preconditions**:
-+    1. The application is running in Browser Mode.
-+- **Steps**:
-+    1. Manually send a WebSocket message of type `error` from the backend to the client.
-+- **Expected Outcome**:
-+    - The `ExecutionService` should handle the message and update the run state to `FAILED`.
-+    - The UI should display an error message in the logs.
-+    - The WebSocket connection should be terminated.
-+
-+## 3. Identified Gaps and Potential Improvements
-+
-+1.  **No State Persistence**: The most significant gap is the lack of state persistence across page reloads. This can lead to a poor user experience, as any page refresh will lose the context of the ongoing run.
-+    - **Suggestion**: Use `localStorage` to store the `runId` of the active run. On application load, check for an active `runId` and, if one exists, automatically reconnect to the WebSocket to resume monitoring.
-+2.  **No Manual Reconnect**: There is no UI mechanism to manually reconnect to a run.
-+    - **Suggestion**: Add a "Reconnect to last run" button if a `runId` is found in `localStorage` but the WebSocket connection fails.
-+3.  **Limited Error Recovery**: The frontend simply displays errors reported by the backend. There are no mechanisms for user-initiated recovery actions (e.g., "retry step," "ignore error").
-+    - **Suggestion**: This is a larger feature, but worth noting. A more robust implementation might include a more sophisticated error handling and recovery workflow.

-+## 2. Comparison with Existing Standards
-+
-+A search for existing labware standards from Opentrons, Hamilton, and SiLA2 did not yield definitive schema documentation. Therefore, the proposed schema is primarily based on the existing `ResourceDefinitionOrm` model in the Praxis codebase. This approach ensures that the labware definitions are compatible with the existing system.
-+
-+Based on general knowledge of lab automation, other standards likely include similar fields, such as:
-+
-+- **Metadata:** Name, version, manufacturer, etc.
-+- **Physical Dimensions:** Overall dimensions, well spacing, etc.
-+- **Well Properties:** Shape, depth, volume, etc.
-+- **Material Properties:** The material the labware is made of.
-+
-+The proposed schema is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new fields as needed.
-+
-+## 3. Validation Rules
-+
-+- **`name`**: Must be a unique string.
-+- **`version`**: Must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
-+- **`dimensions`**: Must be an object with `x`, `y`, and `z` properties, which are all numbers.
-+- **`wells`**: If present, must be an array of objects, each with the required properties.
-+
-+## 4. Submission Workflow Recommendation
-+
-+We recommend a Git-based workflow for submitting new labware definitions:
-+
-+1. **Fork the repository:** The user forks the Praxis repository on GitHub.
-+2. **Create a new branch:** The user creates a new branch for their labware definition.
-+3. **Add the labware definition:** The user adds a new JSON file to a designated `labware` directory.
-+4. **Submit a pull request:** The user submits a pull request to the main Praxis repository.
-+5. **Review and merge:** The Praxis team reviews the pull request and merges it if it meets the required standards.
-+

-+# Skill: Structured Multi-Stage Workflow
-+
-+**Version**: 1.0
-+**Author**: [Your Name/Team]
-+
-+## Overview
-+
-+This skill formalizes the standard Inspect→Plan→Execute development cycle into a structured, multi-stage workflow. It is designed to guide an agent through a systematic process of understanding, implementing, and verifying a change request. Each stage has clear entry and exit criteria, produces specific artifacts, and includes updates to project tracking systems.
-+
-+---
-+
-+## Stage 1: Clarification & Specification
-+
-+**Objective**: To transform an initial user request into a well-defined, actionable specification.
-+
-+**Entry Criteria**:
-+- A new task or change request has been received from the user.
-+
-+**Process**:
-+1.  **Analyze Request**: Carefully read the user's request to understand the high-level goal.
-+2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If the request is ambiguous, incomplete, or contains conflicting requirements, use the `request_user_input` tool to ask targeted questions.
-+3.  **Negotiate Scope**: Work with the user to define clear, achievable boundaries for the task.
-+4.  **Formalize Specification**: Document the agreed-upon requirements.
-+
-+**Exit Criteria**:
-+- All ambiguities in the user request have been resolved.
-+- A clear, documented specification has been agreed upon with the user.
-+
-+**Artifacts**:
-+- **Specification Document**: A clear, written summary of the task requirements, scope, and acceptance criteria. This may be recorded in the agent's internal memory, a project management tool, or a temporary markdown file.
-+
-+**Tracking**:
-+- **Task Status**: Update the task from `New` to `In Progress` or `Specification`.
-+- **Technical Debt**: Log any identified compromises or future work that is out of scope for the current task.
-+
-+---
-+
-+## Stage 2: Inspection & Discovery
-+
-+**Objective**: To build a comprehensive understanding of the existing codebase and its context relevant to the task.
-+
-+**Entry Criteria**:
-+- A clear specification from Stage 1.
-+
-+**Process**:
-+1.  **File & Directory Listing**: Use `list_files` to explore the repository structure.
-+2.  **Code Review**: Use `read_file` to examine relevant files identified in the previous step. Pay attention to coding patterns, existing abstractions, and potential areas of impact.
-+3.  **Search & Grep**: Use `run_in_bash_session` with `grep` to find all occurrences of specific functions, variables, or patterns related to the task.
-+4.  **Read Documentation**: Review `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and any other relevant documentation files.
-+5.  **Synthesize Findings**: Consolidate the gathered information to build a mental model of the change.
-+
-+**Exit Criteria**:
-+- The agent has a sufficient understanding of the codebase to formulate a detailed implementation plan.
-+- All relevant files, modules, and dependencies have been identified.
-+
-+**Artifacts**:
-+- **Discovery Notes**: A collection of findings, including a list of files to be modified, key code snippets, and a summary of the architectural approach.
-+
-+**Tracking**:
-+- **Task Status**: No change, remains `In Progress` or `Specification`.
-+- **Technical Debt**: Update or add items based on discoveries (e.g., outdated dependencies, poor code quality in areas to be modified).
-+
-+---
-+
-+## Stage 3: Planning
-+
-+**Objective**: To create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.
-+
-+**Entry Criteria**:
-+- Completion of the Inspection stage.
-+- A set of discovery artifacts.
-+
-+**Process**:
-+1.  **Decompose the Problem**: Break down the high-level specification into smaller, manageable implementation steps.
-+2.  **Sequence the Steps**: Order the steps logically, considering dependencies between them.
-+3.  **Define Verification for Each Step**: For each step, determine how the outcome will be verified (e.g., "confirm file exists with `ls`," "run unit test and expect it to fail").
-+4.  **Formalize the Plan**: Use the `set_plan` tool to articulate the final plan. The plan must include a pre-commit step for final checks.
-+
-+**Exit Criteria**:
-+- A formal plan has been created and stored using the `set_plan` tool.
-+- The user has approved the plan if it's the first plan for the task.
-+
-+**Artifacts**:
-+- **Implementation Plan**: The structured plan set via the `set_plan` tool.
-+
-+**Tracking**:
-+- **Task Status**: Update to `In Progress` or `Implementation`.
-+
-+---
-+
-+## Stage 4: Execution
-+
-+**Objective**: To implement the code changes as defined in the plan.
-+
-+**Entry Criteria**:
-+- An approved implementation plan from Stage 3.
-+
-+**Process**:
-+1.  **Execute Plan Step-by-Step**: Follow the plan meticulously, executing one step at a time.
-+2.  **Write Code**: Use tools like `write_file` and `replace_with_git_merge_diff` to create or modify files.
-+3.  **Write Tests**: When implementing new features or fixing bugs, write corresponding unit or integration tests. Practice test-driven development where appropriate.
-+4.  **Verify Each Step**: After each modification, use a read-only tool (`read_file`, `list_files`, etc.) to confirm the change was applied correctly.
-+5.  **Mark Step Complete**: Use `plan_step_complete` to move to the next step.
-+
-+**Exit Criteria**:
-+- All steps in the implementation plan have been completed.
-+- The code has been modified and new tests have been written.
-+
-+**Artifacts**:
-+- **Modified Source Code**: The changes made to the repository's files.
-+- **New Tests**: The test files added to validate the changes.
-+
-+**Tracking**:
-+- **Task Status**: Remains `In Progress` or `Implementation`.
-+
-+---
-+
-+## Stage 5: Verification & Submission
-+
-+**Objective**: To validate the completed work against the specification and submit it.
-+
-+**Entry Criteria**:
-+- All plan steps from the Execution stage are complete.
-+
-+**Process**:
-+1.  **Run All Tests**: Execute the entire test suite to ensure the changes have not introduced any regressions.
-+2.  **Perform Pre-Commit Checks**: Call `pre_commit_instructions` and follow all required steps (e.g., linting, static analysis, final verification).
-+3.  **Manual Verification (if applicable)**: If the change impacts a user interface or requires visual confirmation, use appropriate verification tools and generate screenshots.
-+4.  **Submit for Review**: Once all checks pass, use the `submit` tool with a clear, descriptive commit message.
-+
-+**Exit Criteria**:
-+- All tests and pre-commit checks pass.
-+- The change has been successfully submitted.
-+
-+**Artifacts**:
-+- **Test Results**: Output from the test runner.
-+- **Verification Screenshots** (if applicable).
-+- **Commit**: The final commit pushed to the repository.
-+
-+**Tracking**:
-+- **Task Status**: Update to `Completed`, `In Review`, or `Done`.
-+- **Technical Debt**: Ensure all related debt items are linked to the completed task.

-+## 2. CSS Variable Mapping
-+
-+The properties defined in the `theme.json` manifest will be dynamically applied to the application's root element (`:root`) as CSS variables. The existing `styles.scss` is already set up to consume these variables, allowing for runtime theme changes without a full page reload.
-+
-+| Manifest Property                | CSS Variable / DOM Style         | Notes                                                                                             |
-+| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
-+| `theme.colors.primary`           | `--primary-color`                | Overrides the primary color used in the Angular Material theme.                                     |
-+| `theme.colors.secondary`         | `--secondary-color`              | Overrides the secondary color.                                                                    |
-+| `theme.colors.tertiary`          | `--tertiary-color`               | Overrides the tertiary color.                                                                     |
-+| `theme.colors.warn`              | `--warn-color`                   | Overrides the warn/error color.                                                                   |
-+| `theme.glassmorphism.background` | `--glass-bg`                     | Defines the background color and opacity for glassmorphism effects.                               |
-+| `theme.glassmorphism.border`     | `--glass-border`                 | Defines the border for glassmorphism effects.                                                     |
-+| `theme.typography.fontFamily`    | `--font-family`                  | This will be applied to the `<body>` tag.                                                         |
-+| `theme.density.scale`            | N/A                              | This will be handled by a `ThemeService` that applies a class to the body, corresponding to a pre-generated set of density styles. |
-+
-+The `theme.type` (`light` or `dark`) property will be used to toggle a class on the `body` element (e.g., `theme-dark` or `theme-light`), ensuring that the correct base styles from Angular Material are applied before the custom overrides.
-+
-+## 3. Installation and Loading Mechanism
-+
-+The following describes the proposed user flow and technical implementation for managing themes.
-+
-+### User Flow
-+
-+1.  **Theme Installation**: A user can install a new theme by providing a URL to a `theme.json` file or by uploading the file directly. Installed themes will be stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
-+2.  **Theme Switching**: In the application's settings, the user will be presented with a list of installed themes. Selecting a theme will apply it immediately.
-+3.  **Theme Preview**: As the user selects different themes from the list, the UI will update in real-time to preview the changes before the user navigates away from the settings page.
-+
-+### Technical Implementation
-+
-+A `ThemeService` in Angular will be responsible for:
-+-   **Loading and Parsing**: Fetching the `theme.json` file from a URL or reading it from a file upload, then parsing and validating it against the schema.
-+-   **Storing Themes**: Saving the theme manifests to `localStorage` as an array of JSON objects.
-+-   **Applying Themes**: When a theme is selected, the `ThemeService` will:
-+    -   Update the CSS variables on the `:root` element by iterating over the `colors` and `glassmorphism` properties in the manifest.
-+    -   Set the `font-family` on the `<body>` element.
-+    -   Apply the appropriate `theme-light` or `theme-dark` class to the `<body>`.
-+    -   Apply the appropriate density class to the `<body>`.
-+-   **Managing the Active Theme**: The `ThemeService` will keep track of the currently active theme and ensure it's applied on application startup.
-+
-+## 4. Default Theme Variants
-+
-+Praxis will come with a set of default themes that will be bundled with the application and loaded on first launch.
-+
-+-   **Praxis Light (Default)**: The current default theme.
-+    -   `type`: "light"
-+    -   `primary`: "#ED7A9B" (Rose Pompadour)
-+    -   `secondary`: "#F0E68C" (Khaki)
-+    -   `tertiary`: "#73A9C2" (Moonstone Blue)
-+    -   `warn`: "#B22222" (Firebrick)
-+    -   `glassmorphism.background`: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)"
-+    -   `glassmorphism.border`: "1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)"
-+-   **Praxis Dark**: A dark version of the default theme.
-+    -   `type`: "dark"
-+    -   `primary`: "#ED7A9B"
-+    -   `secondary`: "#BDB76B" (Dark Khaki)
-+    -   `tertiary`: "#73A9C2"
-+    -   `warn`: "#CD5C5C" (Indian Red)
-+    -   `glassmorphism.background`: "rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.7)"
-+    -   `glassmorphism.border`: "1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)"
-+-   **High Contrast**: An accessible theme with higher contrast ratios.
-+    -   `type`: "light"
-+    -   `primary`: "#000000"
-+    -   `secondary`: "#FFFF00"
-+    -   `tertiary`: "#0000FF"
-+    -   `warn`: "#FF0000"
-+    -   `glassmorphism.background`: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)"
-+    -   `glassmorphism.border`: "1px solid #000000"
-+
-+## 5. Example Theme Manifest
-+
-+Here is a complete example of a `theme.json` file for a custom "Oceanic" theme.

-+# Research Report: Browser-Mode Simulation Spec
-+
-+This document outlines a proposal for a robust "Simulation Spec" for browser-native protocol execution.
-+
-+## 1. Simulation Protocol Interface
-+
-+This section defines a contract for specifying simulation behavior directly within a protocol. The goal is to create a declarative, co-located, and easily parsable mechanism for defining how a protocol should behave in a simulated environment.
-+
-+### Proposed Solution: `@simulate_output` Decorator
-+
-+We propose a Python decorator, `@simulate_output`, to be applied to protocol functions that generate data (e.g., from a plate reader). This decorator will provide metadata to the simulation engine about the expected output.
-+
-+#### Decorator Signature
-+```python
-+def simulate_output(
-+  shape: tuple[int, int],
-+  range: tuple[float, float],
-+  strategy: str = "uniform"
-+):
-+  # ... decorator logic ...
-+```
-+
-+- **`shape`**: A tuple defining the dimensions of the generated data (e.g., `(8, 12)` for a 96-well plate).
-+- **`range`**: A tuple specifying the minimum and maximum values for the generated data.
-+- **`strategy`**: The data generation strategy to use. Defaults to `"uniform"`, but could be extended to include `"normal"`, `"lognormal"`, etc.
-+
-+#### Example Usage
-+
-+```python
-+from praxis.backend.core.decorators import protocol, simulate_output
-+
-+@protocol(
-+  name="Plate Reader Measurement",
-+  description="A protocol to measure absorbance from a plate."
-+)
-+@simulate_output(shape=(8, 12), range=(0.1, 3.0))
-+def measure_absorbance(plate: Plate) -> list[list[float]]:
-+  """Measures the absorbance of each well in a plate."""
-+  # In a real run, this would interact with hardware.
-+  # In a simulation, the decorator provides the necessary metadata.
-+  pass
-+```
-+
-+### Rationale
-+
-+- **Co-location**: The simulation behavior is defined directly with the protocol function, making it easy to find and understand.
-+- **Declarative**: The decorator declares the *what* (the shape and range of the data) and leaves the *how* (the data generation) to the simulation engine.
-+- **Inspectable**: The simulation engine can easily inspect the protocol function for the presence of this decorator and its arguments at runtime.
-+
-+## 2. Mocking PLR Classes in Pyodide
-+
-+## 2. Mocking PLR Classes in Pyodide
-+
-+This section details the strategy for substituting real PyLabRobot (PLR) hardware classes with simulated versions in a Pyodide environment. The key is to leverage the existing dynamic instantiation mechanism within the `WorkcellRuntime`.
-+
-+### Core Strategy: FQN Substitution
-+
-+The `WorkcellRuntime`'s `MachineManagerMixin` instantiates hardware drivers by dynamically importing a class from a Fully Qualified Name (FQN) stored in the database. This provides a clean seam for simulation.
-+
-+To run a protocol in simulation mode, we will:
-+1.  **Define Simulator Classes**: Create a suite of simulator classes (e.g., `PlateReaderSimulator`) that mirror the public API of their real PLR counterparts.
-+2.  **Use Simulator FQNs**: When a protocol is run in "simulation" mode, the backend will provide the FQN of the simulator class (e.g., `praxis.simulators.PlateReaderSimulator`) to the `WorkcellRuntime` instead of the real hardware FQN (e.g., `pylabrobot.plate_reading.plate_reader.PlateReader`).
-+
-+This approach requires no changes to the core orchestration or protocol execution logic.
-+
-+### Example: `PlateReaderSimulator`
-+
-+Here is a conceptual implementation of a `PlateReaderSimulator`:
-+
-+```python
-+# In a new file: praxis/simulators/plate_reader.py
-+
-+import numpy as np
-+from pylabrobot.resources import Plate
-+
-+class PlateReaderSimulator:
-+    """A simulated plate reader that generates data based on protocol metadata."""
-+
-+    def __init__(self, name: str):
-+        self.name = name
-+
-+    async def read_luminescence(self, plate: Plate, **kwargs) -> list[list[float]]:
-+        # The simulator would need access to the protocol's simulation metadata.
-+        # This could be passed in via the RunContext.
-+        sim_meta = kwargs.get("__praxis_simulation_meta__", {})
-+        
-+        shape = sim_meta.get("shape", (8, 12))
-+        data_range = sim_meta.get("range", (1000, 5000))
-+        
-+        data = np.random.uniform(low=data_range[0], high=data_range[1], size=shape)
-+        return data.tolist()
-+
-+    async def setup(self):
-+        print(f"Simulator '{self.name}' is ready.")
-+
-+    async def stop(self):
-+        print(f"Simulator '{self.name}' is stopped.")
-+```
-+
-+### Integration with `WorkcellRuntime`
-+
-+When the orchestrator prepares for a simulation run, it will fetch the appropriate simulator FQN for each required machine. The `initialize_machine` function in `MachineManagerMixin` will then instantiate the simulator class, and the protocol will execute with the mock object instead of the real hardware.
-+
-+## 3. Simulation State Manager
-+
-+## 3. Simulation State Manager
-+
-+To enable realistic simulation of processes like liquid handling, we need a mechanism to track the state of the virtual workcell. The `PraxisRunContext`, which already manages the application's canonical state, is the ideal place to house this simulation state.
-+
-+### Extending `PraxisRunContext`
-+
-+We will extend the `PraxisRunContext` to include a `simulation_state` attribute. This attribute will hold a dictionary representing the state of all resources in the simulation.
-+
-+```python
-+class PraxisRunContext:
-+    # ... existing attributes ...
-+    
-+    def __init__(self, ..., is_simulation: bool = False):
-+        # ... existing initialization ...
-+        self.is_simulation = is_simulation
-+        self.simulation_state = {} if is_simulation else None
-+
-+    def get_simulation_state(self, resource_name: str) -> dict:
-+        """Gets the state for a given resource."""
-+        if not self.is_simulation:
-+            return {}
-+        return self.simulation_state.setdefault(resource_name, {})
-+
-+    def update_simulation_state(self, resource_name: str, new_state: dict):
-+        """Updates the state for a given resource."""
-+        if self.is_simulation:
-+            self.simulation_state[resource_name] = new_state
-+```
-+
-+### Simulator Interaction with State
-+
-+The simulator classes (like a `LiquidHandlerSimulator`) will interact with the `simulation_state` via the `PraxisRunContext`, which is already passed to every protocol function.
-+
-+#### Example: `LiquidHandlerSimulator`
-+
-+```python
-+# In a new file: praxis/simulators/liquid_handler.py
-+
-+from pylabrobot.resources import Plate, Well
-+
-+class LiquidHandlerSimulator:
-+    """A simulated liquid handler that tracks liquid volumes."""
-+
-+    def __init__(self, name: str, run_context: "PraxisRunContext"):
-+        self.name = name
-+        self.run_context = run_context
-+
-+    async def aspirate(self, well: Well, volume: float):
-+        """Simulates aspirating liquid from a well."""
-+        well_state = self.run_context.get_simulation_state(well.name)
-+        current_volume = well_state.get("volume", 0)
-+
-+        if current_volume < volume:
-+            raise RuntimeError(f"Not enough liquid in {well.name} to aspirate {volume}uL.")
-+
-+        well_state["volume"] = current_volume - volume
-+        self.run_context.update_simulation_state(well.name, well_state)
-+        print(f"Aspirated {volume}uL from {well.name}. New volume: {well_state['volume']}uL.")
-+
-+    async def dispense(self, well: Well, volume: float):
-+        """Simulates dispensing liquid into a well."""
-+        well_state = self.run_context.get_simulation_state(well.name)
-+        current_volume = well_state.get("volume", 0)
-+
-+        well_state["volume"] = current_volume + volume
-+        self.run_context.update_simulation_state(well.name, well_state)
-+        print(f"Dispensed {volume}uL to {well.name}. New volume: {well_state['volume']}uL.")
-+
-+    async def setup(self):
-+        print(f"Simulator '{self.name}' is ready.")
-+
-+    async def stop(self):
-+        print(f"Simulator '{self.name}' is stopped.")
-+```
-+
-+### Initial State
-+
-+The `initial_state_data` parameter in the `execute_protocol` method of the `Orchestrator` can be used to seed the `simulation_state` with the starting liquid volumes and other resource states for a protocol run. This allows for flexible and realistic simulation scenarios.

-+
-+- **Stop the Test Database**:
-+  ```bash
-+  sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
-+  ```
-+
-+## Manual Migration Process
-+
-+When you cannot connect to a database to use the `autogenerate` feature, you must create migrations manually. This is the most reliable method for a distributed team.
-+
-+### 1. Create a Blank Migration File
-+
-+First, generate a new, empty migration script:
-+
-+```bash
-+uv run alembic revision -m "a_descriptive_name_for_your_change"
-+```
-+
-+This will create a new file in `alembic/versions/` with a unique revision ID.
-+
-+### 2. Edit the Migration File
-+
-+Open the newly created file. It will contain a basic template. You will fill in the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions with the necessary schema changes using Alembic's `op` object.
-+
-+#### Manual Migration Template
-+
-+Here is a standard template to follow:
-+
-+```python
-+"""A brief, human-readable title for the migration.
-+
-+Revision ID: <your_revision_id>
-+Revises: <previous_revision_id>
-+Create Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MS
-+
-+"""
-+
-+from collections.abc import Sequence
-+
-+import sqlalchemy as sa
-+from alembic import op
-+
-+# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
-+revision: str = "<your_revision_id>"
-+down_revision: str | Sequence[str] | None = "<previous_revision_id>"
-+branch_labels: str | Sequence[str] | None = None
-+depends_on: str | Sequence[str] | None = None
-+
-+
-+def upgrade() -> None:
-+  """Commands to apply the migration."""
-+  # ### commands auto-generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
-+  pass
-+  # ### end Alembic commands ###
-+
-+
-+def downgrade() -> None:
-+  """Commands to revert the migration."""
-+  # ### commands auto-generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
-+  pass
-+  # ### end Alembic commands ###
-+
-+```
-+
-+### 3. Common Migration Operations
-+
-+Below are copy-paste-ready examples for the most common database operations.
-+
-+#### Example: Creating a New Table
-+
-+- **`upgrade()`**: Use `op.create_table()` to define the new table and its columns.
-+- **`downgrade()`**: Use `op.drop_table()` to remove the table.
-+
-+```python
-+def upgrade() -> None:
-+    op.create_table(
-+        'protocols',
-+        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
-+        sa.Column('name', sa.String(length=255), nullable=False),
-+        sa.Column('description', sa.Text(), nullable=True),
-+        sa.Column('created_at', sa.DateTime(), server_default=sa.text('now()'), nullable=False),
-+        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
-+    )
-+
-+def downgrade() -> None:
-+    op.drop_table('protocols')
-+```
-+
-+#### Example: Adding a New Column
-+
-+- **`upgrade()`**: Use `op.add_column()` to add a new column to an existing table.
-+- **`downgrade()`**: Use `op.drop_column()` to remove it.
-+
-+```python
-+def upgrade() -> None:
-+    op.add_column('protocols', sa.Column('is_archived', sa.Boolean(), server_default='false', nullable=False))
-+
-+def downgrade() -> None:
-+    op.drop_column('protocols', 'is_archived')
-+```
-+
-+#### Example: Altering an Existing Column
-+
-+This example makes an existing column nullable. It's based on a real migration in this repository.
-+
-+- **`upgrade()`**: Use `op.alter_column()` to modify a column's constraints (e.g., `nullable`).
-+- **`downgrade()`**: Revert the change in the `downgrade` function.
-+
-+```python
-+def upgrade() -> None:
-+  op.alter_column(
-+    "resources",
-+    "resource_definition_accession_id",
-+    nullable=True,
-+    existing_type=sa.UUID(),
-+  )
-+
-+def downgrade() -> None:
-+  op.alter_column(
-+    "resources",
-+    "resource_definition_accession_id",
-+    nullable=False,
-+    existing_type=sa.UUID(),
-+  )
-+```
-+
-+## `autogenerate` Workaround
-+
-+The `alembic revision --autogenerate` command is a powerful feature that compares your SQLAlchemy models to the current state of the database and automatically generates the migration script. However, it **requires a direct connection to a PostgreSQL database**.
-+
-+If you wish to use this feature, you can do so by running the local test database.
-+
-+### Workflow
-+
-+1.  **Ensure Your Models are Up-to-Date**: Make sure your SQLAlchemy ORM models in `praxis/backend/models/orm/` reflect the schema changes you want to make.
-+
-+2.  **Start the Test Database**:
-+    ```bash
-+    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
-+    ```
-+
-+3.  **Run the Latest Migrations**: Apply all existing migrations to the test database so it is up-to-date.
-+    ```bash
-+    uv run alembic upgrade head
-+    ```
-+
-+4.  **Generate the Migration Script**: Run the `autogenerate` command.
-+    ```bash
-+    uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "A short description of the autogenerated changes"
-+    ```
-+
-+5.  **Review the Generated Script**: Alembic is not perfect. **Always review the generated migration script** in `alembic/versions/` to ensure it is correct and does not make unintended changes. Make any necessary adjustments manually.
-+
-+6.  **Stop the Test Database**:
-+    ```bash
-+    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
-+    ```

-+# WebSerial Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) Testing Guide
-+
-+This document outlines the manual testing procedures for verifying WebSerial-based hardware discovery and communication in Praxis. Due to current CI limitations, this process is a critical step to ensure hardware compatibility before merging related changes.
-+
-+## 1. Required Hardware
-+
-+To perform these tests, you will need access to the following physical hardware:
-+
-+- **Hamilton STARlet**: Liquid handler.
-+- **Hamilton STAR**: Liquid handler.
-+- **BMG CLARIOstar**: Plate reader.
-+- **Opentrons OT-2**: Liquid handler.
-+- A computer with a recent version of **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** (verifying WebSerial API support).
-+- Necessary USB cables to connect each instrument.
-+
-+## 2. Browser Permission Setup
-+
-+The WebSerial API requires explicit user permission to access serial devices. This is a critical security feature of the browser.
-+
-+1.  **Initial Connection**: The first time you attempt to connect to a device from the Praxis UI, the browser will display a permission dialog in the top-left corner.
-+2.  **Device List**: The dialog will show a list of available serial devices detected by the operating system.
-+3.  **Granting Access**: Select the correct device from the list and click "Connect". This grants the Praxis web application access to that device for the current session.
-+4.  **Revoking Access**: Permissions can be managed or revoked by clicking the lock icon in the address bar and navigating to "Site settings".
-+
-+**Note**: If the expected device does not appear in the list, it may be due to a driver issue, a faulty cable, or another application holding a lock on the serial port. See the Troubleshooting section for more details.
-+
-+## 3. Step-by-Step Testing Procedure
-+
-+Follow these steps for each piece of hardware listed above.
-+
-+1.  **Physical Connection**:
-+    - Ensure the hardware is powered on.
-+    - Connect the device directly to your computer via a USB cable. Avoid using USB hubs if possible, as they can sometimes introduce instability.
-+
-+2.  **Launch Praxis**:
-+    - Start the Praxis application stack.
-+    - Navigate to the "Hardware" -> "Discovery" page in the web client.
-+
-+3.  **Initiate Scan**:
-+    - Click the "Scan for Devices" button.
-+    - The browser should prompt you for permission to access a serial device.
-+
-+4.  **Select Device**:
-+    - In the browser's device selection dialog, find and select the target hardware (e.g., "Hamilton STARlet").
-+    - Click "Connect".
-+
-+5.  **Verify Discovery**:
-+    - The UI should update to show that the device has been discovered.
-+    - A new card representing the hardware should appear on the screen, displaying its name and status.
-+    - Confirm that the displayed information (e.g., model name) is correct.
-+
-+6.  **Test Communication (If Applicable)**:
-+    - For devices with interactive controls (like liquid handlers), attempt a simple action if the UI supports it (e.g., "Home axes").
-+    - This step verifies that the command-response loop is functional.
-+
-+7.  **Disconnect and Repeat**:
-+    - Physically disconnect the device.
-+    - The device's status in the UI should update, perhaps to "Disconnected" or by being removed from the list.
-+    - Reconnect the device and ensure it can be discovered again.
-+    - Repeat this process for all required hardware.
-+
-+## 4. Known VID/PID Mappings
-+
-+This section provides the standard Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) pairs used by the application to identify supported hardware.
-+
-+| Device             | Vendor ID (VID) | Product ID (PID) |
-+| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
-+| Hamilton STARlet   | `0x08BB`        | `0x0107`         |
-+| Hamilton STAR      | `0x08BB`        | `0x0106`         |
-+| BMG CLARIOstar     | `0x0403`        | `0xBB68`         |
-+| Opentrons OT-2     | `0x04D8`        | `0xE11A`         |
-+
-+This mapping is crucial for the hardware discovery service to correctly filter and identify compatible devices.
-+
-+## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues
-+
-+**Issue: Device not appearing in the browser's selection list.**
-+
-+- **Driver Issues**: Ensure the necessary FTDI or serial port drivers are installed on your operating system. Windows usually handles this automatically, but macOS or Linux may require manual installation.
-+- **Cable Fault**: Try a different USB cable.
-+- **Port Lock**: Another application (e.g., a vendor-specific control software, a terminal emulator like PuTTY) might be holding the serial port open. Close all other applications that might be communicating with the device.
-+- **Permissions**: On Linux, you may need to add your user to the `dialout` group (`sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`) to have permission to access serial devices.
-+
-+**Issue: Device is discovered but communication fails.**
-+
-+- **Incorrect Baud Rate/Settings**: This is unlikely if using the official Praxis software but could be an issue in development. The application must connect with the correct serial port settings (baud rate, data bits, etc.).
-+- **Firmware Issues**: The device's firmware may be in a bad state. Try power cycling the instrument.
-+
-+**Issue: Browser does not ask for permission.**
-+
-+- **WebSerial Not Supported**: Ensure you are using a compatible browser (Chrome, Edge).
-+- **Insecure Context**: The WebSerial API is only available on secure contexts (`https://` or `localhost`). Ensure you are accessing the Praxis frontend accordingly.

-## 🔴 CRITICAL PATH (Must complete before merge)
-
-### 1. Docstrings - 90 Files (DISPATCH NEEDED)
-
-- **Session**: `15718507772184055229`
-- **Status**: Completed
-- **Issue**: Won't auto-apply due to size
-- **Action**: ➡️ **Dispatch to antigravity pull agent**
-- This is the largest change and should be applied FIRST
-
-### 2. Import Ordering
-
-- **Session**: `7833557422181935314`
-- **Status**: Completed (2 files)
-- **Quick fix**: `ruff format praxis/backend/models` can reformat 9 files
-- **Action**: Try `ruff format --check praxis/` first, then apply session if needed
-
-### 3. Pause/Resume Protocol
-
-- **Session**: `17486039806276221924`
-- **Status**: Completed (7 files)
-- **Action**: `jules remote pull --session 17486039806276221924 --apply`
-
-### 4. Browser Interrupt
-
-- **Session**: `7966319430585451351`
-- **Status**: Awaiting User Feedback (7 files)
-- **Extraction**: `.agent/reports/extracted_browser_interrupt.md` ✅
-- **Action**: Manual integrate from extraction report (layer on top of pause/resume)
-
-### 5. Geometry Heuristics (TD-702)
-
-- **Session**: `16235462376134233538`
-- **Status**: Paused (2 files)
-- **Extraction**: `.agent/reports/extracted_geometry_heuristics.md` ✅
-- **Action**: Manual integrate from extraction report
-
-### 6. PLR Category Audit
-
-- **Session**: `9570037443858871469`
-- **Status**: Completed (6 files)
-- **Backlog**: `.agent/backlog/plr_category_architecture.md`
-- **Action**: `jules remote pull --session 9570037443858871469 --apply`
-- **Includes**: Filter fixes for backend + frontend, new tests
-
-### 7. Error Boundaries x2
-
-- `7169150082809541249` (3 files)
-- `9326114167496894643` (4 files)
-- **Action**: Apply both with `--apply`
-
----
-
-## 🟡 MIGRATION-CONFLICTING (IMPORTANT - Protocol Functionality)
-
-These are **NOT deferrable** if protocols need to work end-to-end:
-
-### Selective Transfer Heuristic (TD-701)
-
-- **Session**: `12822272099245934316`
-- **Status**: Awaiting User Feedback (9 files)
-- **Contains**: `requires_linked_indices` field (protocols needing linked source/dest)
-- **Migration Conflict**: Created migrations that conflict with fresh baseline
-- **Action**: Extract logic, apply to fresh schema manually
-
-### Infinite Consumables (TD-901)
-
-- **Session**: `12408408457884280509`
-- **Status**: Awaiting User Feedback (7 files)
-- **Contains**: `infinite_consumables` flag for assets (tips pools, etc.)
-- **Migration Conflict**: Modified alembic/env.py + deleted existing migration
-- **Action**: Extract the ORM/pydantic changes, create new migration
-- **Key Files**:
-  - `praxis/backend/models/orm/asset.py` - adds `infinite_consumables` column
-  - `praxis/backend/core/scheduler.py` - skips reservation for infinite assets
-  - `tests/core/test_infinite_consumables.py` - new test

-## 4. CRITICAL CONFLICTS - MANUAL MERGE REQUIRED
-
-### 🔴 Case A: Conflicting Migrations
-
-Both sessions attempted to create the **same migration file** (`alembic/versions/3a1fe0851e06...`).
-
-- 12822272099245934316 (Selective Transfer Heuristic)
-- 12408408457884280509 (Infinite Consumables)
-**Action**: Rename one migration, manually merge changes.
-
-### 🔴 Case B: Protocol Execution Service
-
-Both sessions heavily modified `execution.service.ts` and `live-dashboard.component.ts`.
-
-- 17486039806276221924 (Pause/Resume)
-- 7966319430585451351 (Browser Interrupt)
-**Action**: Apply "Pause/Resume" first, then manually layer "Browser Interrupt" logic on top.
-
-### 🔴 Case C: PLR Categories vs. Machine Registration
-
-Both touch `praxis/backend/models` and potentially core filters.
-
-- 9570037443858871469 (PLR Category Audit)
-- 7588975548984364060 (Backend Machine Registration)
-**Action**: Review `pydantic_internals/filters.py` for conflicts.
-
-## Recommended Execution Order
-
-1. Apply **Group 1** (Clean Applies).
-2. Apply **Group 2** (Global Refactors) - resolve `machine.py` conflict.
-3. Extract **Group 3** (E2E Specs) - discarding config changes.
-4. Manually merge **Group 4** (Conflicts).

-# Investigation Report: Per-Machine Argument Configuration
-
-**Task ID:** 260121152037
-**Status:** COMPLETE
-**Finding:** MISSING_FEATURE
-
-## Summary
-
-The investigation into the "Run Protocol" wizard confirmed that there is currently no mechanism for users to configure machine-specific parameters (e.g., ports, connection settings, simulation options) during the machine selection step.
-
-While the backend and data models (`Machine`, `MachineDefinition`) support these configurations via `backend_config` and `connection_config` fields, the frontend UI does not expose these fields to the user.
-
-## Detailed Findings
-
-### 1. Machine Selection Flow
-
-- In `RunProtocolComponent`, the **Select Machine** step uses `MachineSelectionComponent`.
-- When a machine is selected:
-  - If it's a **Template**, it opens `SimulationConfigDialogComponent`.
-  - If it's an **Existing Machine**, it simply sets the selection and allows the user to click "Continue".
-- There is no "Configure" step or dialog for existing machines.
-
-### 2. Dialog Limitations
-
-- `SimulationConfigDialogComponent` is currently restricted to only two fields:
-  - `name` (Instance Name)
-  - `simulation_backend_name` (e.g., "Chatterbox", "Simulator")
-- It ignores the `connection_config` schema available in the `MachineBackendDefinition`.
-
-### 3. Model & Service Support
-
-- **Models:** Files like `asset.models.ts` and `schema.ts` define `backend_config` (Record) and `capabilities_config` (JSON) which are intended for this purpose.
-- **Services:** `AssetService` provides methods to create and update machines with these configurations.
-- **Execution:** `ExecutionService` (browser mode) already looks for `port_id` and `baudrate` in the `backend_config` of the resolved machine asset:
-
-  ```typescript
-  // From execution.service.ts
-  machineConfig = {
-    backend_fqn: definition.fqn,
-    port_id: instance?.backend_config?.port_id,
-    baudrate: instance?.backend_config?.baudrate,
-    is_simulated: definition.is_simulation_override || false
-  };
-  ```
-
-  Since the UI never populates `backend_config`, these values are always `undefined`.
-
-## Conclusion
-
-The issue is a **MISSING_FEATURE**. The infrastructure for machine configuration exists in the data layer but is not yet wired up in the Run Protocol wizard's UI.
-
-## Recommended Next Steps
-
-1. **Implement Dynamic Form:** Create a component that renders a form based on `MachineCapabilityConfigSchema`.
-2. **Expand Simulation Dialog:** Update `SimulationConfigDialogComponent` to include the dynamic form for backend/connection settings.
-3. **Add Edit Capability to Wizard:** Allow users to "Configure" an existing machine selection in the wizard step if they need to change connection parameters (e.g., swapping a serial port).
-4. **Execution Mapping:** Ensure that when a run is started, the specific `backend_config` for that machine instance is correctly passed to the execution environment.

-# Machine Type Filtering Investigation Report
-
-## Status
-
-**In Progress - Diagnosis Phase**
-
-We have identified a contradiction between the codebase logic and the reported behavior. The code explicitly attempts to filter *out* LiquidHandlers for deck-less protocols, yet the user reports seeing *only* LiquidHandlers.
-
-## Key Findings
-
-### 1. Code Logic Contradiction
-
-In `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/run-protocol.component.ts`, the filtering logic explicitly handles `requires_deck === false`:
-
-```typescript
-// Filter based on deck requirement
-if (protocol?.requires_deck === false) {
-  // If deck not required, hide LiquidHandlers
-  allCompat = allCompat.filter(d =>
-    d.machine.machine_category !== 'LiquidHandler' &&
-    d.machine.machine_category !== 'HamiltonSTAR'
-  );
-}
-```
-
-This logic *should* prevent LiquidHandlers from appearing for the "Plate Reader Assay". The fact that they *do* appear suggests one of two critical failures:
-
-1. **Property Loss:** The `requires_deck` property is returning `true` or `undefined` at runtime for the Plate Reader Assay.
-2. **Category Mismatch:** The "Simulated Plate Reader" is not being loaded, leaving only specific fallback templates that might be hardcoded elsewhere.
-
-### 2. Protocol and Database Definition
-
-The source of truth appears correct:
-
-- **Protocol Source (`plate_reader_assay.py`)**: Explicitly sets `requires_deck=False` and `param_metadata` for a `PlateReader`.
-- **Database Generation (`generate_browser_db.py`)**: Correctly parses this property and inserts it into the `function_protocol_definitions` table.
-- **Seed Data (`plr-definitions.ts`)**: Contains a `Simulated Plate Reader` with `machine_type: 'PlateReader'`.
-
-### 3. Debugging Obstacles
-
-Attempts to verify runtime state via E2E tests (`debug-machine-filtering.spec.ts`) have been blocked by environmental instability:
-
-- The "Plate Reader Assay" card was not visible in the test environment Protocol List, causing the test to fail before entering the wizard.
-- This suggests the `SqliteService` might not be successfully loading the generated `praxis.db` or `schema.sql` in the test runner's browser instance, potentially falling back to an empty state or legacy defaults.
-
-## Hypotheses & Next Steps
-
-### Hypothesis A: `requires_deck` is lost in `SqliteService` transformation
-
-The `SqliteService.getProtocols()` method maps raw DB rows to `FunctionProtocolDefinition` objects. If the boolean mapping `p['requires_deck'] === 1` is incorrect or the column is missing in the query, it might default to `undefined` (falsy), but the filter checks `=== false`.
-
-**Action:** Audit `SqliteService.getProtocols()` mapping logic for `requires_deck`.
-
-### Hypothesis B: Mock Data Templates are Incomplete
-
-In `ExecutionService.getCompatibility()` (Browser Mode), we map `machineDefinitions` to compatibility templates. If `sqliteService.machineDefinitions` returns only default LiquidHandlers, the filtering logic has nothing else to show (or shows nothing, and maybe there's a separate "show default" fallback I missed).
-
-**Action:** Verify the `Simulated Plate Reader` definition is actually making it into `machine_definitions` table in the browser.
-
-## Recommendations for Orchestrator
-
-1. **Manual Verification**: If possible, manually load the app and check the Network tab/Console logs for the `requires_deck` property on the selected protocol.
-2. **Fix E2E Data Loading**: The E2E tests need a guaranteed way to ensure the database is seeded. We should consider a `test.beforeEach` that forces a DB reset/seed.
-3. **Review `SqliteService` Mapping**: A targeted code review of the `resultToObjects` and specific field mapping in `sqlite.service.ts` is the highest ROI next step.

-# Investigation: On-the-Fly Simulation Definition Creation
-
-## Executive Summary
-
-The Playground currently lacks a UI for creating *definitions* (types of machines/resources) on the fly. While the backend API fully supports creating `MachineDefinition`, `ResourceDefinition`, and `DeckDefinition` entities via POST endpoints, the frontend `AssetWizard` only allows instantiating *existing* definitions.
-
-## Findings
-
-### 1. Existing Capabilities
-
-- **Frontend Search**: `grep` confirmed no "create definition" logic exists in `AssetWizard` or `Playground`.
-- **Backend API**: The following endpoints are generated and available in `MachineDefinitionsService`, `ResourceDefinitionsService`, and `DeckTypeDefinitionsService`:
-  - `POST /api/v1/machines/definitions`
-  - `POST /api/v1/resources/definitions`
-  - `POST /api/v1/decks/types`
-
-### 2. "On-the-Fly" Creation Scope
-
-To support true dynamic simulation, the user needs to define the *topology* of the simulated hardware, not just instantiate it.
-
-- **Machines**:
-  - **Use Case**: User wants to simulate a generic "3-Axis Portal" or a "Custom Shaker" that isn't in the PLR catalog.
-  - **Fields Needed**: Name, Capabilities (RPM, Temp), Dimensions (x, y, z), Compatible Backends (set to 'Simulated').
-- **Resources**:
-  - **Use Case**: User uses a specific brand of 96-well plate not in the library.
-  - **Fields Needed**: Dimensions (x, y, z), Well Count, Well Volume, Well Shape (V-bottom/Flat), Tip Volume.
-- **Decks**:
-  - **Use Case**: User has a custom bench layout.
-  - **Fields Needed**: Slot definitions (coordinates, carrier types).
-
-## Feature Specification
-
-### New Feature: Definition Builder
-
-A standalone dialog or a "Create New" action within the `AssetWizard` search step.
-
-#### Workflow
-
-1. User opens Inventory -> Add Asset.
-2. In the "Select Definition" step, if search yields no results (or explicitly via button), user clicks **"Create Custom Definition"**.
-3. **Definition Wizard** opens:
-    - **Step 1: Category**: Machine vs Resource.
-    - **Step 2: Basic Info**: Name, Model, Manufacturer.
-    - **Step 3: Geometry/Physics**:
-        - *Resource*: X, Y, Z, Wells, Volume.
-        - *Machine*: Capabilities (JSON editor or form fields).
-    - **Step 4: Save**: Calls `createApiV1...Post`.
-4. The new definition is automatically selected in the `AssetWizard`.
-
-## Effort Estimate
-
-- **Backend**: **Low** (0 days). Endpoints exist.
-- **Frontend**: **High** (3-5 days).
-  - Requires robust forms for geometric data validation.
-  - Requires UI for defining capabilities (possibly JSON schema form).
-  - Integration into existing `AssetWizard` flow.
-  - Browser-mode mock support (needs to persist new definitions to SQLite `machine_definitions` table).
-
-## Recommendation
-
-Implement a "Basic Resource Builder" first (plate/tube rack) as it has the highest impact for simulation fidelity. Complex machine definitions can remain a "Configuration Code" task for now.

-# Oracle Advisory: Asset Wizard Investigation Report
-
-**Date:** 2026-01-21  
-**Dispatch ID:** d260121182523962_fa3b  
-**Task ID:** 260121181800  
-**Advisory Type:** Architecture & Debugging
-
----
-
-## Executive Summary
-
-This investigation analyzed the Asset Wizard and Run Protocol guided setup components to evaluate five reported issues. The "No definitions found" bug has been resolved, but the architecture reveals opportunities for improvement in the simulated toggle, category filtering, and terminology clarification.
-
----
-
-## Issue Analysis
-
-### 1. ✅ "No definitions found" Bug - RESOLVED
-
-**Current Implementation (Lines 131-149 of asset-wizard.ts):**
-
-```typescript
-const assetType$ = this.typeStepFormGroup.get('assetType')!.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(''));
-const category$ = this.categoryStepFormGroup.get('category')!.valueChanges.pipe(startWith(''));
-const query$ = this.searchSubject.pipe(startWith(''), debounceTime(300), distinctUntilChanged());
-
-this.searchResults$ = combineLatest([assetType$, category$, query$]).pipe(
-  switchMap(([assetType, category, query]) => {
-    if (!assetType) return of([]);
-    if (assetType === 'MACHINE') {
-      return this.assetService.searchMachineDefinitions(query).pipe(
-        map(defs => defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === 'Machine'))
-      );
-    } else {
-      return this.assetService.searchResourceDefinitions(query, category);
-    }
-  })
-);
-```
-
-**Assessment:** The logic is **robust**. Key safeguards:
-
-- ✅ Uses `combineLatest` ensuring all three streams have values before emitting
-- ✅ `startWith('')` provides initial values, preventing cold-start issues
-- ✅ Guard clause `if (!assetType) return of([])` handles empty state
-- ✅ Machine definitions properly filtered to exclude raw backends (`plr_category === 'Machine'`)
-
-**Minor Recommendations:**
-
-1. Consider adding error handling with `catchError` to prevent stream termination on API errors
-2. Add loading state indicator during search
-
----
-
-### 2. ⚠️ Missing Simulated Toggle in Asset Wizard
-
-**Context:** The Machine Registry (`machine-filters.component.ts`) has a mature simulated toggle implementation (lines 92-114), but the Asset Wizard lacks this feature.
-
-**Current State:**
-
-- `MachineFiltersComponent` has a 3-state toggle: All / Physical / Simulated
-- `AssetWizard` has no equivalent filter during definition selection
-
-**Recommendation:**
-
-```xml
-<advice type="architecture">
-<question>Should the Asset Wizard include a simulated/physical filter?</question>
-<context>
-- The wizard creates new asset instances from definitions
-- Browser mode auto-selects simulated backends (line 186-190)
-- Definition cards show "Simulated" or "Real Only" badges (lines 140-147 in HTML)
-</context>
-<options>
-  <option name="Add toggle to Step 3 (Definition)">
-    <pros>Consistent with machine filters UX; reduces cognitive load</pros>
-    <cons>Adds UI complexity; redundant given badge indicators</cons>
-  </option>
-  <option name="Keep current approach (badges only)">
-    <pros>Simpler UI; badges provide at-a-glance info</pros>
-    <cons>No way to filter when many definitions exist</cons>
-  </option>
-</options>
-<recommendation>Add toggle ONLY if definition count exceeds 20 items</recommendation>
-<reasoning>
-The wizard already auto-selects simulated backends in browser mode.
-The "Simulated/Real Only" badges on cards provide visual distinction.
-A toggle becomes valuable only with many definitions.
-</reasoning>
-<risks>Low - Either approach works well for current scale</risks>
-</advice>
-```
-
----
-
-### 3. ⚠️ Category Filtering Not Applied to Machine Definitions
-
-**Current Behavior:**
-
-- Step 2 selects a category (e.g., "LiquidHandler")
-- Step 3 searches **all** machine definitions, ignoring the selected category
-
-**Root Cause (line 142-144):**
-
-```typescript
-return this.assetService.searchMachineDefinitions(query).pipe(
-  map(defs => defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === 'Machine'))  // Only filters by type, not category!
-);
-```
-
-**Comparison with Resources (line 146):**
-
-```typescript
-return this.assetService.searchResourceDefinitions(query, category);  // ✅ Category is passed
-```
-
-**Recommendation:**
-
-```xml
-<advice type="debugging">
-<symptom>Machine category selection doesn't filter definitions</symptom>
-<hypotheses>
-  <hypothesis likelihood="high">
-    <cause>searchMachineDefinitions() doesn't accept category parameter</cause>
-    <test>Check AssetService.searchMachineDefinitions signature</test>
-  </hypothesis>
-</hypotheses>
-<recommended_approach>
-1. Add machine_category filter to searchMachineDefinitions:
-   ```typescript
-   searchMachineDefinitions(query: string, category?: string): Observable<MachineDefinition[]> {
-     return this.getMachineDefinitions().pipe(
-       map(defs => defs.filter(d =>
-         (d.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) || ...) &&
-         (!category || d.machine_category === category)
-       ))
-     );
-   }
-   ```
-
-2. Update asset-wizard.ts line 142:
-
-   ```typescript
-   return this.assetService.searchMachineDefinitions(query, category).pipe(
-     map(defs => defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === 'Machine'))
-   );
-   ```
-
-</recommended_approach>
-</advice>
-
-```
-
----
-
-### 4. 📊 Data Model Analysis: `plr_category` vs `machine_category`
-
-**Findings from `generate_browser_db.py`:**
-
-| Field | Usage | Example Values |
-|-------|-------|----------------|
-| `plr_category` | Distinguishes Machine vs Resource vs Backend | `"Machine"`, `"Plate"`, `"TipRack"` |
-| `machine_category` | Specific machine type | `"LiquidHandler"`, `"PlateReader"`, `"Centrifuge"` |
-
-**Current Filter Logic:**
-- `asset-wizard.ts:143` filters by `plr_category === 'Machine'` to exclude backends
-- `generate_browser_db.py:210` sets `plr_category = "Machine"` for all frontends
-
-**Assessment:** The data model is **correct and intentional**:
-- `plr_category` serves as an asset-type discriminator
-- `machine_category` provides granular type classification
-- This dual-field approach enables both broad (Machine/Resource) and narrow (LiquidHandler/PlateReader) filtering
-
----
-
-### 5. 🔤 Chatterbox vs Simulated Terminology
-
-**Findings:**
-
-| Term | Definition | Usage Pattern |
-|------|------------|---------------|
-| **Simulated** | Generic term for any non-hardware backend | UI-facing, user-friendly |
-| **Chatterbox** | Specific PLR backend class naming convention | Code-facing, PLR-specific |
-
-**Evidence:**
-- `generate_browser_db.py:686`: `backend_type = "simulator" if "Chatterbox" in backend.fqn`
-- Frontend refers to "Simulated" in UI labels
-- `availableSimulationBackends` in wizard: `['Simulated', 'Chatterbox']`
-
-**Recommendation:**
-
-```xml
-<advice type="architecture">
-<question>How should we handle Chatterbox vs Simulated terminology?</question>
-<context>
-- PLR uses "Chatterbox" as the class suffix for simulation backends
-- End users understand "Simulated" better than "Chatterbox"
-- Current system mixes both terms
-</context>
-<options>
-  <option name="Normalize to 'Simulated' in UI">
-    <pros>User-friendly; consistent mental model</pros>
-    <cons>May confuse developers familiar with PLR</cons>
-  </option>
-  <option name="Keep hybrid approach">
-    <pros>Technical accuracy preserved</pros>
-    <cons>Inconsistent UX</cons>
-  </option>
-</options>
-<recommendation>Normalize to "Simulated" in UI, preserve "Chatterbox" in code/logs</recommendation>
-<reasoning>
-Users don't need to know internal PLR naming conventions.
-Backend type classification already uses "simulator" vs "hardware".
-The mapping already exists in generate_browser_db.py.
-</reasoning>
-<risks>None - purely cosmetic change</risks>
-</advice>

-## Implementation Plan
-
-| Priority | Issue | Action | Effort | Files |
-|----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
-| **P1** | Category filter for machines | Add `category` param to `searchMachineDefinitions()` | 30 min | `asset.service.ts`, `asset-wizard.ts` |
-| **P2** | Terminology normalization | Map "Chatterbox" → "Simulated" in UI display | 15 min | `asset-wizard.ts` |
-| **P3** | Simulated toggle | Add optional toggle to Definition step | 1 hr | `asset-wizard.ts`, `asset-wizard.html` |
-| **P4** | Error handling | Add `catchError` to `searchResults$` | 15 min | `asset-wizard.ts` |
-
----
-
-## Conclusion
-
-The Asset Wizard is architecturally sound with one **functional gap**: category filtering for machine definitions. The terminology confusion (Chatterbox vs Simulated) is cosmetic but should be addressed for UX consistency. The "No definitions found" bug is resolved, and the Observable chain is robust.
-
-**Oracle Recommendation:** Proceed with P1 (category filter) as the primary fix. Other items can be addressed in subsequent iterations.

-# Reconnaissance Report: Guided Setup Visual State Transitions
-
-## Summary of Investigation
-
-This report documents the reconnaissance performed to analyze a reported UI state issue in a "guided setup" feature. The investigation was unable to locate the specified feature, and therefore cannot provide the requested analysis. This report details the search process and provides recommendations for moving forward.
-
-### Search Process
-
-The investigation began with a search for the files and CSS classes mentioned in the task description:
-
-*   **File:** `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/components/guided-setup/guided-setup.component.ts`
-*   **CSS Classes:** `.requirement-card`, `.setup-card`
-
-When these searches yielded no results, the investigation was broadened to include a systematic search of the codebase. The following steps were taken:
-
-1.  **File and Directory Listing:** The contents of the `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/` directory and its `components` subdirectory were listed to identify any components that might contain the guided setup feature. The components found were `run-protocol.component.ts` and `live-dashboard.component.ts`.
-
-2.  **File Analysis:** The following files were read and analyzed:
-    *   `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/components/run-protocol.component.ts`
-    *   `praxis/web--client/src/app/features/run-protocol/components/live-dashboard.component.ts`
-    *   `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/run-protocol.routes.ts`
-    *   `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/execution.service.ts`
-
-3.  **Keyword Searches:** The entire `praxis/web-client` directory was searched for the following keywords:
-    *   `guided-setup`
-    *   `requirement-card`
-    *   `stepper`
-    *   `carrier`
-
-4.  **Full File Listing:** A full listing of all `.ts` files in the `praxis/web-client` directory was generated and reviewed to identify any other potential locations for the guided setup feature.
-
-## Findings
-
-The investigation concluded that **the guided setup feature, as described in the task, could not be located within the codebase.** None of the specified files or CSS classes were found, and extensive searches for related keywords did not reveal any components with similar functionality.
-
-As a result, it is not possible to provide the requested analysis, which included:
-
-*   Documentation of the current state machine
-*   CSS class mapping
-*   Identification of missing state transitions
-*   A gap analysis of the carrier step
-*   Implementation recommendations
-
-It is likely that the feature either has a different name than "guided setup," is located in a different part of the codebase than was indicated, or does not yet exist.
-
-## Recommendations
-
-To proceed with the analysis, it is recommended that the user provide more specific information about the feature's location. This could include:
-
-*   **The correct file name** of the component that contains the guided setup feature.
-*   **The route** that is used to access the feature in the application.
-*   **Any other relevant information** that could help to locate the feature, such as the name of a parent component or a related service.

-# Research Report: Infinite Consumables & Resource Depletion
-
-## 1. Executive Summary
-
-Currently, **"Infinite Consumables" is the default behavior** in both the Backend and Browser-Only modes.
-
-* **Depletion Logic**: There is no mechanism that persists the consumption of tips or liquids (volume reduction) back to the `Resources` database table after a protocol run.
-* **Browser Mode**: The `web_bridge.py` layer instantiates new PyLabRobot (PLR) resource objects for every run based on static definitions. It does not load previous state (e.g., used tips), meaning every run starts with full tip racks and fresh liquids.
-* **Backend Mode**: While the `WorkcellRuntime` tracks state in memory and saves a full state snapshot to the `Workcell` table (`latest_state_json`), this state is not decomposed to update individual `Resource` records. Subsequent runs do not re-hydrate from the `Workcell` snapshot in a way that affects `ConsumableAssignmentService`.
-
-## 2. Analysis of Depletion Logic
-
-### 2.1 Backend Mode
-
-* **Location**: `praxis/backend/core/workcell_runtime/`
-* **Mechanism**: The `WorkcellRuntime` maintains `_active_resources` (live PLR objects). The `StateSyncMixin` periodically serializes the entire workcell state and saves it to the `Workcells` table column `latest_state_json`.
-* **Missing Link**:
-  * The `ConsumableAssignmentService` (`praxis/backend/core/consumable_assignment.py`) queries the `Resources` table to find compatible assets.
-  * The `AssetManager.release_resource` method (`praxis/backend/core/asset_manager/resource_manager.py`) updates the resource **status** (e.g., `AVAILABLE_IN_STORAGE`) but does NOT update the `properties_json` or `plr_state` with the final tip count/volume.
-  * Consequently, the `Resources` table always reflects the static definition (full capacity), leading to "infinite" behavior.
-
-### 2.2 Browser-Only Mode
-
-* **Location**: `praxis/web-client/src/assets/python/web_bridge.py` and `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/services/execution.service.ts`
-* **Mechanism**:
-  * `ExecutionService` generates a Python script that calls `resolve_parameters` in `web_bridge.py`.
-  * `resolve_parameters` iterates through input arguments and instantiates **fresh** PLR objects (e.g., `res.TipRack(...)`) using only the `num_items` and dimensions from the definition.
-  * There is no code to fetch `initial_state_json` (e.g., previously used tips) and apply it to the new PLR objects.
-  * `web_bridge.py` emits `WELL_STATE_UPDATE` to the UI for visualization, which is logged to `function_call_logs`, but `SqliteService` does not parse this to update the `Resources` inventory.
-
-## 3. Implementing Finite Consumables (Depletion)
-
-To implement "Finite Consumables" (tracking depletion), the following changes would be required:
-
-1. **Persistence (Browser & Backend)**:
-    * **Backend**: In `_finalize_protocol_run`, extract the final state of all consumables (tip racks, reservoirs) from the `WorkcellRuntime` and pass it to `AssetManager.release_resource` via `final_properties_json_update` to update the `Resources` table.
-    * **Browser**: In `ExecutionService`, after a run completes, parse the final `WELL_STATE_UPDATE` or `final_state_json` and use `SqliteService` to update the local `Resources` table `properties_json`.
-
-2. **Re-hydration**:
-    * **Backend**: `ConsumableAssignmentService` must respect `properties_json` (e.g., `tips_used_mask`) when checking availability.
-    * **Browser**: `web_bridge.py`'s `resolve_parameters` must accept an `initial_state` dictionary (loaded from DB) and apply it to the instantiated PLR objects (e.g., removing tips that are marked as used).
-
-## 4. Option to Skip Depletion (Simulation Mode)
-
-Since "Infinite Consumables" is the current state, creating an option to **skip** depletion would simply mean **retaining the current behavior** for Simulation runs once Persistence is implemented.
-
-* **Design**:
-  * Add a flag `update_inventory: bool` to `ProtocolRun` or execution context.
-  * **If `update_inventory=False` (Simulation)**: Do not perform the "Persistence" step described above. The DB remains untouched.
-  * **If `update_inventory=True` (Physical/Tracked)**: Perform the DB update.
-
-## 5. Runtime Unique ID Creation
-
-The requirement to "allow runtime unique ID creation for tip racks" addresses the need to track *specific* physical tip racks (e.g., "TipRack A vs TipRack B").
-
-* Currently, `ConsumableAssignmentService` selects existing resources.
-* To support runtime creation, the frontend `GuidedSetup` or `DeckSetupWizard` should allow users to "Register New Consumable" on the fly, generating a UUID and creating a `Resource` record before the run starts.
-
-## 6. Recommendations
-
-1. **Acknowledge Current State**: Inform users that "Infinite Consumables" is currently the only supported mode.
-2. **Implementation Plan**:
-    * Implement **State Re-hydration** first (make PLR objects load state from DB).
-    * Implement **State Persistence** second (save state to DB on run completion).
-    * Add the **Simulation Gate** to prevent persistence during simulation runs.

-# Investigation: Add Resource vs. Add Machine Flow in Playground
-
-## Executive Summary
-
-Both "Add Machine" and "Add Resource" flows in the Playground are broken due to the same root cause: a schema mismatch in the SQLite `initDb` seeding logic where the `plr_category` column is left `NULL`, causing frontend filters to return empty results.
-
-## Comparison
-
-| Feature | Status | Root Cause |
-| :--- | :--- | :--- |
-| **Add Machine** | **Broken** | `AssetWizard` filters by `plr_category === 'Machine'`, but SQLite maps `machine_type` -> `machine_category`. `plr_category` is NULL. |
-| **Add Resource** | **Broken** | `AssetService` filters by `plr_category === category`, but SQLite maps `plr_category` -> `resource_type`. `plr_category` is NULL. |
-
-## Detailed Analysis
-
-### 1. Add Machine Flow
-
-- **UI Logic**: `AssetWizard` hardcodes a filter: `defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === 'Machine')`.
-- **Data State**: In SQLite `machine_definitions` table, `plr_category` is NULL. The category data resides in `machine_category`.
-- **Result**: Filter returns 0 results. User sees "No definitions matching search".
-
-### 2. Add Resource Flow
-
-- **UI Logic**: `AssetWizard` calls `assetService.searchResourceDefinitions(query, category)`.
-- **Service Logic**: `AssetService` executes: `defs.filter(d => d.plr_category === plrCategory)`.
-- **Data State**: In SQLite `resource_definitions` table, `plr_category` is NULL. The category data from `PLR_RESOURCE_DEFINITIONS` is mapped to the `resource_type` column during seeding.
-- **Result**: Filter returns 0 results. User sees "No definitions matching search".
-
-### 3. Common Issues
-
-- **Schema Mapping**: The `SqliteService` seeding logic maps the category field to a specific column (`machine_category` / `resource_type`) but the valid `plr_category` column (present in the schema) is ignored and left NULL.
-- **Frontend Expectation**: The frontend consistently expects `plr_category` to be populated for filtering, which aligns with the generated API schema but contradicts the browser-mode data seeding.
-
-## Recommendations
-
-1. **Fix SQLite Seeding**: Update `SqliteService.ts` to populate the `plr_category` column for both machines and resources during seeding.
-    - Map `def.machine_type` -> `plr_category` (and `machine_category`).
-    - Map `def.plr_category` -> `plr_category` (and `resource_type`).
-
-2. **Fix Frontend Logic (Machines)**: Update `AssetWizard` to use `machine_category` or remove the redundant 'Machine' filter entirely, as `searchMachineDefinitions` only returns machines.
-
-3. **Fix Frontend Logic (Resources)**: Update `AssetService.getResourceDefinitions` (Browser Mode branch) to fallback to `resource_type` if `plr_category` is missing, or rely on the DB fix.

-# Report: Simulation Backend Dropdown Bug Fix
-
-## Problem
-
-In the Run Protocol wizard, when configuring a simulation, the "Simulation Backend" dropdown displayed malformed options (e.g., individual characters or JSON brackets) instead of full backend names.
-
-## Root Cause
-
-The `MachineDefinition` table in the browser SQLite database stores `available_simulation_backends` as a JSON string. However, the generic `SqliteRepository` was only configured to automatically parse columns ending in `_json`. Since `available_simulation_backends` (and other columns like `capabilities`, `compatible_backends`, etc.) did not follow this naming convention, they were returned as raw strings. The Angular `@for` directive then iterated over the characters of the string instead of the elements of an array.
-
-## Implementation
-
-Instead of a localized fix in the component, a systemic fix was implemented in the database infrastructure:
-
-- Modified `praxis/web-client/src/app/core/db/sqlite-repository.ts` to:
-  - Automatically deserialize columns ending in `_config`.
-  - Automatically deserialize specific known JSON columns: `capabilities`, `compatible_backends`, `available_simulation_backends`, `user_configured_capabilities`, `plr_state`, `plr_definition`, `allowed_resource_definition_names`, `compatible_resource_fqns`, and `tags`.
-  - Correctly map boolean columns `requires_deck` and `is_simulated_frontend` from SQLite (0/1) to TypeScript (boolean).
-
-## Verification
-
-- Code review confirms that `available_simulation_backends` is now correctly parsed into an array before reaching the component.
-- The fix also addresses potential metadata corruption in other areas (e.g., `capabilities` and `capabilities_config`) that were suffering from the same lack of deserialization.
-
-## Status
-
-Fixed in repository layer.

-# Simulation Selection Investigation
-
-## Button Location
-
-- **File**: `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/components/simulation-config-dialog/simulation-config-dialog.component.ts`
-- **Line**: 74
-- **Text**: "Create Simulation"
-
-## Logic Trace
-
-1. **Click Handler**: `(click)="confirm()"` calls `confirm()` in `SimulationConfigDialogComponent`.
-2. **Dialog Close**: `confirm()` verifies form validity and calls `this.dialogRef.close(this.form.value)`.
-3. **Parent Component Handling**:
-   - `RunProtocolComponent` (in `praxis/web-client/src/app/features/run-protocol/run-protocol.component.ts`) opens the dialog via `configureSimulationTemplate`.
-   - Subscribes to `dialogRef.afterClosed()`.
-   - If result exists, proceeds to create ephemeral machine.
-
-## Findings
-
-### 1. Backend Matching Logic Mismatch (High Probability)
-
-In `configureSimulationTemplate`, the code attempts to find a matching backend definition:
-
-```typescript
-const backend = backends.find(b => 
-  b.backend_type === 'simulator' && 
-  (b.name === result.simulation_backend_name || b.fqn.includes(result.simulation_backend_name.toLowerCase()))
-);
-```
-
-- **Observed Data**:
-  - `result.simulation_backend_name` (from `available_simulation_backends`): typically `pylabrobot.liquid_handling.backends.ChatterboxBackend`.
-  - `b.name` (from `PLR_BACKEND_DEFINITIONS`): derived from machine name, e.g., "Simulated Liquid Handler".
-  - `b.fqn` (from `PLR_BACKEND_DEFINITIONS`): matches machine FQN, e.g., `praxis.simulated.LiquidHandler`.
-
-- **Result**: The match fails (`backend` is `undefined`) because:
-  - "Simulated Liquid Handler" !== "pylabrobot.liquid_handling.backends.ChatterboxBackend"
-  - "praxis.simulated.LiquidHandler" does not include "pylabrobot..."
-
-- **Consequence**: `ids.backendId` is `undefined`. While `SqliteService.createMachine` appears to handle missing definition IDs gracefully (by falling back to string-based FQN lookup or defaults), passing `undefined` to the `createMachine` API (if in production mode) or strictly typed internals could cause issues.
-
-### 2. Silent Failure Risk
-
-The `configureSimulationTemplate` method has error handling that logs to console (`console.error('Failed to create simulation machine', err)`), but it does not provide UI feedback. If the observable chain fails (e.g., if `getMachineFrontendDefinitions` throws or returns empty), the user sees no effect.
-
-### 3. Form Validation
-
-The "Create Simulation" button is disabled if `configForm` is invalid.
-
-- Requires `name` and `simulation_backend_name`.
-- `simulation_backend_name` options come from `definition.available_simulation_backends`.
-- `Simulated Liquid Handler` defines these options, so the form should be valid.
-
-## Recommended Fix
-
-1. **Update Backend Matching Logic**:
-   Relax the matching logic in `run-protocol.component.ts` to fallback to any simulator backend if a precise name match isn't found, or update `PLR_BACKEND_DEFINITIONS` to include the specific backend class names as aliases.
-
-2. **UI Feedback**:
-   Add a snackbar or alert in the `error` block of `configureSimulationTemplate` to notify the user if creation fails.
-
-3. **Verify Observables**:
-   Ensure `getMachineFrontendDefinitions` and `getBackendsForFrontend` are returning data correctly in the browser-mode `SqliteService`.
-
-## Resolution (2026-01-21)
-
-- **Backend Matching Logic Fixed**: Updated `RunProtocolComponent.configureSimulationTemplate` to include an exact match check followed by a fallback to the first available simulator backend for the given machine type.
-- **UI Feedback Added**: Integrated `MatSnackBar` to provide real-time feedback when:
-  - A compatible simulator backend is not found (fallback warning or error).
-  - The simulation machine creation fails (using an error snackbar).
-- **Improved Robustness**: Changed `fqn.includes(...)` to `fqn === ...` for exact matching, reducing ambiguity while ensuring fallbacks handle mismatched metadata gracefully.

-
-## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0)
-
-### 1. "No definitions found" - All Definition Searches Broken
-
-**Impact**: Cannot add machines/resources in Asset Wizard, blocks testing live instrument interface and REPL hardware connection
-
-**Symptom**: Asset Wizard Step 2 shows "No definitions found matching ''" for all searches
-
-**Root Cause Investigation Needed**:
-
-- `generate_browser_db.py` now seeds `plr_category` correctly
-- DB shows correct data: 20 machines with `plr_category='Machine'`, 141 resources
-- Frontend filtering may still be broken
-- Check: `AssetWizard.searchResults$` Observable chain
-- Check: `SqliteService` or `AssetService` query methods
-
-**Dispatch Recommendation**: Use `@oracle` persona for deep reconnaissance
-
----
-
-### 2. protocol_runs Schema Missing Column
-
-**Error**: `table protocol_runs has no column named protocol_definition_accession_id`
-
-**Impact**: Cannot create protocol runs, execution fails
-
-**Fix Needed**:
-
-- Add column to `praxis/web-client/src/assets/db/schema.sql`
-- Regenerate `praxis.db`
-- May also need to update `generate_browser_schema.py`
-
----
-
-### 3. Build Error - Missing Method
-
-**Error**: `Property 'isSelectiveTransferProtocol' does not exist on type 'RunProtocolComponent'`
-**File**: `run-protocol.component.ts:685`
-
-**Fix**: Add missing method or remove the call
-
----
-
-## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues
-
-### 4. Selective Transfer Still Shows 2 Well Args (4.1)
-
-**Expected**: Single `indices` parameter
-**Actual**: Still showing `source_wells` and `target_wells` separately
-**May need**: Protocol regeneration or parameter definition update
-
-### 5. Autocomplete Display Value Not Updating (2.5.1)
-
-**Expected**: Show selected asset name after selection
-**Actual**: Still shows first/original item
-
-### 6. Autocomplete Dropdown Positioning (2.5.3)
-
-**Issues**:
-
-- Should be pushed further left
-- Should stay same size with selected items
-
-### 7. Deck Setup Resource Dialog Style (5.1)
-
-**Current**: Items visible but no dynamic highlighting as each is confirmed
-**Expected**: Same step-by-step highlighting as Step 2, one item at a time with Done
-
-### 8. Run Not Found After Creation (6.1)
-
-**Symptom**: Execution Monitor says "Run not found"
-**Likely Related To**: #2 (protocol_runs schema issue)

-## 🔴🔴🔴 SUPER TOP PRIORITY (P0) 🔴🔴🔴
-
-### 0. Playground Inventory vs Asset Management - DIFFERENT FLOWS NEEDED
-
-**URGENT**: User needs to test PlateReader connection from Jupyter kernel before going home.
-
-**Current Problem**: Asset Wizard in Playground tries to CREATE new assets when it should let user SELECT EXISTING machines from DB.
-
-#### Required UX/Architecture
-
-| Context | Machine Flow | Resource Flow |
-|---------|--------------|---------------|
-| **Asset Management** | Create NEW from definition | Create NEW from definition |
-| **Playground Inventory** | Select EXISTING from DB | Create NEW (same as Asset Mgmt) |
-| | OR simulate on-the-fly | OR select existing |
-
-#### Key Requirements
-
-1. **Playground Machine Selection**:
-   - Index and display EXISTING machines from database
-   - User picks an already-created machine instance
-   - Definition/config step ONLY for simulation mode
-   - Both simulated AND real machines must be selectable
-
-2. **Simulation Support**:
-   - If user wants to SIMULATE a machine in Playground, they can
-   - This is the ONLY case where definition/config applies in Playground
-
-3. **Resource Flow**:
-   - Same in both contexts (create new OR select existing)
-   - No special conditional logic needed
-
-4. **Machine Flow Conditional Logic**:
-   - Detect context: `isPlaygroundContext` vs `isAssetManagementContext`
-   - Playground + Machine → Show existing DB machines + simulate option
-   - Asset Management + Machine → Show definitions for creation
-
-5. **Backend Types Bug**:
-   - STILL showing backend types in lists
-   - Filter to `plr_category === 'Machine'` must be enforced
-
-#### Implementation Hints
-
-```typescript
-// In AssetWizard or caller
-if (this.context === 'playground' && this.assetType === 'MACHINE') {
-  // Show existing machines from machines table
-  this.machines$ = this.assetService.getMachines(); // NOT definitions
-  // Add "Simulate New..." option at bottom
-} else {
-  // Current flow: show definitions for creation
-  this.searchResults$ = this.assetService.searchMachineDefinitions(...);
-}
-```

-
-## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0)
-
-### 1. Backend Types RETURNED to Category List (REGRESSION)
-
-**Status**: Was supposedly fixed, now broken again  
-**Impact**: Asset Wizard shows backend types mixed with user-facing definitions  
-**Symptom**: Backends appearing in category selection, mixing simulated/real incorrectly
-
-### 2. Run Protocol Machine Selection - NO CHOICES VISIBLE
-
-**Status**: BLOCKING  
-**Impact**: Cannot proceed with protocol execution at all  
-**Symptom**: Machine selection shows empty list, cannot assess downstream steps
-
-### 3. Protocol Run "Selective Transfer" Regression
-
-**Status**: CRITICAL REGRESSION  
-**Symptom**: `transfer_pattern` and `replicate_count` parameters RESTORED to Selective Transfer  
-**Impact**: Parameters that were removed are back, unclear how this happened
-
----
-
-## 🔴 Critical Errors from Console

-```
-
-**Impact**: Direct Control crashes when selecting a method
-
-### 5. Direct Control Shows Wrong UI
-
-**Symptom**: "Select method" shows simulated types and backends, NOT methods with arguments

-
-## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND
-
-### 1. Linked Indices Diff Bug (Session `16296747416823548932`)
-
-The diff tries to add `InvalidWellSetsError` to `errors.py` but:
-
-- Defines it 3 times
-- References `PraxisError` before it's defined
-
-**Action Needed**: Manual fix before applying. The tracer logic is fine, just the error class definition needs cleanup.
-
-### 2. Multi-Vendor Deck Diff Missing Dependencies
-
-Session `6138709097205002465` references:
-
-- `DeckTypeDefinitionService` (not created)
-- `DeckTypeDefinitionCreate` / `DeckTypeDefinitionUpdate` pydantic models (not created)
-
-**Action Needed**: Create these missing services/models before applying.
-
-### 3. Browser Simulation is Research Only
-
-Session `4768660011143247829` produced only a markdown research doc proposing:
-
-- `@simulate_output` decorator
-- FQN substitution for simulators
-- `PraxisRunContext.simulation_state`
-
-**Action Needed**: Dispatch implementation task based on this design.

+# RECON Report: Jules Environment Setup
+
+## 1. Current Setup Complexity
+
+The current development environment setup is moderately complex due to its multi-part nature, involving a Python backend, an Angular frontend, and several backing services managed by Docker.
+
+- **Dependency Management**: Requires two separate package managers (`uv` for Python, `npm` for Node.js).
+- **Service Orchestration**: Relies on Docker Compose with multiple files (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`) to manage services like PostgreSQL, Redis, and Keycloak.
+- **Fragmented Scripts**: Setup and execution commands are spread across the root `Makefile`, shell scripts in `/scripts`, and `package.json` scripts within `praxis/web-client`.
+- **Two Distinct Modes**: The application can run in a full-stack "production" mode or a a frontend-only "browser" mode, each with a different setup process.
+
+This fragmentation presents a significant challenge for an automated agent like Jules, which must navigate different directories and execute a precise sequence of commands to establish a working environment.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Production Mode Setup
+
+Production mode (or a full-stack development equivalent) requires running the backend services, the backend API server, and the frontend development server simultaneously.
+
+### Steps:
+
+1.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
+    - The backend relies on packages defined in `pyproject.toml`.
+    - Install them using `uv`:
+      ```bash
+      uv sync
+      ```
+
+2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
+    - The frontend is an Angular application located in `praxis/web-client`.
+    - Navigate to the directory and install Node.js packages using `npm`:
+      ```bash
+      cd praxis/web-client
+      npm install --legacy-peer-deps
+      cd ../..
+      ```
+    *(Note: `--legacy-peer-deps` is often required for older Angular projects to resolve dependency conflicts.)*
+
+3.  **Start Backend Services (Ephemeral Mode)**:
+    - The `Makefile` provides a convenient target to start all required services (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.) in a temporary, data-in-RAM mode. This is the recommended approach for development and testing.
+    - From the project root, run:
+      ```bash
+      make dev-ephemeral
+      ```
+    - This command uses `docker-compose` to spin up the services in the background.
+
+4.  **Start Frontend Development Server**:
+    - The `Makefile` also has a target to start the Angular development server, which is configured to proxy requests to the backend.
+    - From the project root, run:
+      ```bash
+      make frontend-dev
+      ```
+    - This executes the `scripts/dev-frontend.sh` script, which starts the Angular live server. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Browser-Only Mode Setup
+
+This mode is ideal for frontend development that does not require a live backend. It runs the Angular application in a standalone configuration, likely using mock data for services.
+
+### Steps:
+
+1.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
+    - If not already done, install the Node.js packages.
+      ```bash
+      cd praxis/web-client
+      npm install --legacy-peer-deps
+      cd ../..
+      ```
+
+2.  **Start Frontend in Browser Mode**:
+    - The `Makefile` provides a direct command for this.
+    - From the project root, run:
+      ```bash
+      make frontend-browser
+      ```
+    - This executes `npm run start:browser` within the `praxis/web-client` directory. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Environment Variables
+
+The application configuration is managed by `praxis.ini`, but these settings can be overridden by environment variables, which is the standard practice when running in Docker. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the following critical variables for the `backend` service:
+
+-   **`DATABASE_URL`**: The connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
+    -   *Example*: `postgresql://praxis:praxis@praxis-db:5432/praxis_db`
+
+-   **`REDIS_URL`**: The connection string for the Redis server.
+    -   *Example*: `redis://redis:6379/0`
+
+-   **`CELERY_BROKER_URL`**: The URL for the Celery message broker, which uses Redis.
+    -   *Example*: `redis://redis:6379/0`
+
+-   **`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`**: The URL for the Celery result backend, also using Redis.
+    -   *Example*: `redis://redis:6379/0`
+
+These variables ensure the backend application can connect to its required backing services within the Docker network. For local development or testing outside of the provided Docker setup, these variables would need to be set manually to point to the correct service locations.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Blockers for Jules Execution
+
+An automated agent like Jules would face several hurdles when attempting to set up the environment and run tests:
+
+-   **Multi-Location Dependency Installation**: The agent must be aware that it needs to run `uv sync` in the root directory for the backend and `npm install` in the `praxis/web-client` subdirectory for the frontend. A single, top-level setup command is missing.
+
+-   **Implicit Knowledge**: The setup requires knowing that `npm install` might need the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, which is not explicitly documented. An agent would likely encounter errors and need to deduce this solution.
+
+-   **Complex Test Execution**:
+    -   **Backend**: Running backend tests is straightforward with `make test`, but running tests that require a database involves a separate script (`./scripts/test-with-db.sh`) or manually managing Docker services (`make db-test`).
+    -   **Frontend**: Running frontend tests requires navigating to `praxis/web-client` and executing `npm run test` (for unit tests) or `npx playwright test` (for e2e tests), the latter of which also requires the dev server to be running.
+
+-   **Lack of a Unified Interface**: There is no single command to set up the entire project or run all checks and tests. An agent would need to discover and execute a sequence of `make`, `uv`, `npm`, and shell script commands in the correct order and directories. This increases the likelihood of error and makes the process brittle.
+
+---
+
+## 6. Proposed Makefile Targets for Simplification
+
+To address these blockers, the following `Makefile` targets could be added to provide a unified, high-level interface for setting up and testing the application.
+
+### Unified Setup
+
+```makefile
+.PHONY: setup
+
+setup:
+	@echo "Installing all backend and frontend dependencies..."
+	@uv sync
+	@cd praxis/web-client && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
+	@echo "Setup complete."
+
+```
+-   **`make setup`**: A single command to install all dependencies for both the Python backend and the Angular frontend. This removes the need for an agent to know about the different package managers and subdirectories.
+
+### Unified Testing
+
+```makefile
+.PHONY: test-all test-frontend
+
+test-all: test test-frontend
+	@echo "All backend and frontend tests passed."
+
+test-frontend:
+	@echo "Running frontend unit and e2e tests..."
+	@cd praxis/web-client && npm run test
+	@(cd praxis/web-client && npm run start > /dev/null 2>&1 &)
+	@sleep 10 # Wait for dev server to start
+	@cd praxis/web-client && npx playwright test
+	@kill $$(lsof -t -i :4200)
+
+```
+-   **`make test-all`**: A top-level command that runs both the backend Python tests and all frontend tests.
+-   **`make test-frontend`**: A dedicated command to run all frontend tests, including starting the development server required for Playwright e2e tests and shutting it down afterward.
+
+These targets would provide a simplified and more robust command-line interface, making the project significantly easier for an automated agent to manage.
