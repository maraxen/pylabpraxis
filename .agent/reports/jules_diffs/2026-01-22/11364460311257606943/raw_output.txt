+# Reconnaissance Report: Versioning Strategy and Roadmap
+
+## 1. Current State Summary
+
+- **Current Version**: `0.0.1` (as per `pyproject.toml`)
+- **Roadmap Documents**: 
+    - `ROADMAP.md`: Outlines long-term strategic goals such as a plugin marketplace, local NLP, and DAG optimization.
+    - `POST_SHIP.md`: Details immediate priorities for the v0.1-Alpha+ release, focusing on a robust database and schema generation pipeline.
+- **Inconsistencies**: The project has two separate roadmap documents, which could lead to confusion.
+
+## 2. Recommended Versioning Scheme
+
+We recommend adopting the **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** specification (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
+
+- **`MAJOR`**: Incremented for incompatible API changes.
+- **`MINOR`**: Incremented for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
+- **`PATCH`**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.
+
+For the initial development phase (i.e., `0.x.x`):
+
+- The API should be considered unstable.
+- **`0.MINOR.PATCH`**: Minor versions will be used for new features and breaking changes, and patch versions for bug fixes.
+- **Pre-release tags**: Use tags like `-alpha`, `-beta`, and `-rc` to denote the stability of a release (e.g., `0.1.0-alpha.1`).
+
+## 3. Milestone Proposal
+
+- **v0.1 (Alpha Release)**:
+    - **Focus**: Initial stabilization and core functionality.
+    - **Features**:
+        - Robust database and schema generation pipeline (`POST_SHIP.md`).
+        - Basic protocol execution.
+        - Core UI/UX for defining and running protocols.
+
+- **v0.2 (Beta Release)**:
+    - **Focus**: Feature expansion and API refinement.
+    - **Features**:
+        - Initial implementation of the DAG optimization for protocol execution (`ROADMAP.md`).
+        - Begin work on the plugin and definition marketplace infrastructure (`ROADMAP.md`).
+        - UI/UX polish based on feedback from the alpha release.
+
+- **v1.0 (Stable Release)**:
+    - **Focus**: Public API stability and feature completeness.
+    - **Features**:
+        - Stable and well-documented API for protocol execution and third-party integrations.
+        - A functional plugin and definition marketplace with a vetted database of definitions (`ROADMAP.md`).
+        - Integration of local NLP for protocol generation (`ROADMAP.md`).
+
+## 4. Release Cadence Recommendation
+
+- **Minor Releases (e.g., 0.1, 0.2)**: Monthly release cycle.
+- **Patch Releases (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2)**: As needed for bug fixes and security patches.
+- **Pre-releases (e.g., 0.1.0-alpha.1)**: Weekly or bi-weekly for continuous testing.
+
+## 5. Roadmap Consolidation Suggestions
+
+To improve clarity and reduce confusion, we recommend consolidating `ROADMAP.md` and `POST_SHIP.md` into a single, unified `ROADMAP.md` file. This file should be structured to show the long-term vision, as well as the immediate and near-term priorities.
