+# Reconnaissance Report: .gitignore Audit
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+
+This report provides a detailed audit of the repository's `.gitignore` files and version control practices. The analysis indicates that while the existing `.gitignore` files provide a decent baseline for a Python and Node.js project, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed. Key problems include a large vendored dependency, tracked binary files, local database files, and screenshots from E2E tests.
+
+This report recommends updating the `.gitignore` files to exclude these problematic files and removing them from the Git history to reduce the repository's size and improve its health.
+
+## 2. Current `.gitignore` Pattern Analysis
+
+The repository contains two `.gitignore` files: one at the root and another in `praxis/web-client`.
+
+*   **Root `.gitignore`:** The root `.gitignore` file contains a comprehensive set of rules for a typical Python project, covering common artifacts such as `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, virtual environment directories, and build outputs. It also includes patterns for common tools like `pytest`, `mypy`, and `ruff`.
+*   **`praxis/web-client/.gitignore`:** The `.gitignore` file in the web client's subdirectory is well-configured for a standard Angular project. It correctly ignores `node_modules`, build artifacts, and editor-specific files.
+
+Overall, the existing patterns are well-structured and provide a solid foundation. However, there are some gaps and improperly tracked files that need to be addressed.
+
+## 3. Problematic Tracked Files
+
+The following files are currently tracked in the repository but should be ignored:
+
+*   **`external/pylabrobot` (105M):** This directory appears to be a vendored copy of the `pylabrobot` library. It is the largest single item in the repository and should not be tracked in version control. Instead, it should be managed as a dependency, for example, by referencing it as a Git submodule or installing it via a package manager.
+*   **`.agent/scripts/jules-diff-tool/jules-diff-tool` (3.2M):** This is a large, compiled binary file. Binary executables should not be tracked in Git. This tool should be built from source as part of a development setup process or downloaded from a release artifact.
+*   **`praxis.db` and `praxis/web-client/src/assets/db/praxis.db` (832K and 884K):** These appear to be SQLite database files. Local database files should not be version-controlled, as they are specific to a local development environment and can change frequently.
+*   **E2E Screenshots:** The `praxis/web-client/e2e/screenshots` directory contains numerous PNG files that appear to be screenshots from Playwright E2E tests. These are test artifacts and should not be committed to the repository.
+
+## 4. Missing `.gitignore` Patterns
+
+The following patterns are missing from the `.gitignore` files:
+
+*   **`*.db`:** There is no global pattern to ignore database files. This would prevent files like `praxis.db` from being accidentally committed.
+*   **`praxis/web-client/e2e/screenshots/`:** The root `.gitignore` file attempts to ignore `praxis/web-client/e2e/screenshot/` (singular), but the actual directory is `screenshots` (plural). This typo means the rule is not effective.
+
+## 5. Recommended `.gitignore` Updates
+
+To address the issues identified in this report, I recommend the following changes:
+
+1.  **Add to root `.gitignore`:**
+    *   Add `*.db` to ignore all database files.
+    *   Add `external/` to ignore the vendored `pylabrobot` dependency.
+    *   Add `.agent/scripts/jules-diff-tool/jules-diff-tool` to ignore the binary tool.
+    *   Correct the typo in the screenshot directory pattern to `praxis/web-client/e2e/screenshots/`.
+
+2.  **Remove problematic files from Git history:**
+    *   Simply adding these files to `.gitignore` will not remove them from the repository's history. To completely remove them, you will need to use a tool like `git-filter-repo` or the BFG Repo-Cleaner. This is a destructive operation that will rewrite the repository's history, so it should be done with caution.
+
+By implementing these recommendations, you will significantly reduce the size of the repository, improve its overall health, and prevent environment-specific files from being shared among developers.
