+# RECON - CHANGELOG.md Setup Research
+
+This report details the research and recommendations for establishing a `CHANGELOG.md` for the Praxis project.
+
+## Recommended Format
+
+It is recommended to adopt the **Keep a Changelog** format. This format is human-readable, well-structured, and has become a widely accepted standard. It organizes changes by version and categorizes them into sections:
+
+- `Added` for new features.
+- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
+- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be-removed features.
+- `Removed` for now-removed features.
+- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
+- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
+
+To support this, it is also recommended to adopt the **Conventional Commits** specification for all git commit messages. This will create a structured commit history that can be programmatically parsed to generate changelog entries.
+
+## Integration Approach
+
+1.  **Create `CHANGELOG.md`**: The `CHANGELOG.md` file should be created at the root of the repository.
+2.  **Link from Documentation**: A link to the `CHANGELOG.md` file should be added to the main documentation navigation in `docs/index.md`. A new section, such as "Release History," would be appropriate.
+
+## Automation Options
+
+While direct Google searches for automation tools were unsuccessful during this reconnaissance, the use of Conventional Commits opens up the possibility of using popular and well-maintained tools to automate the changelog generation process. The following tools are known to work well for this purpose and should be investigated further:
+
+-   **git-cliff**: A highly customizable changelog generator written in Rust.
+-   **standard-version**: A tool for versioning using semver and CHANGELOG generation powered by Conventional Commits.
+
+## Initial CHANGELOG.md Draft Outline
+
+```markdown
+# Changelog

+All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
