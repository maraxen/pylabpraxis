+# Reconnaissance Report: WebHID Transport Shim Status
+
+## 1. Current Implementation Status: Complete
+
+The WebHID transport shim for PyLabRobot exists and is fully implemented. The entry in `.agent/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` stating that the shim is "Missing" is outdated and incorrect.
+
+The implementation is located at: `praxis/web-client/src/assets/shims/web_hid_shim.py`.
+
+The shim is correctly integrated into the Pyodide environment patching logic via `praxis/web-client/src/assets/shims/pyodide_io_patch.py`, which replaces the standard `pylabrobot.io.hid.HID` class with the `WebHID` implementation at runtime.
+
+## 2. Implemented Methods
+
+The `WebHID` class provides a complete implementation of the `pylabrobot.io.hid.HID` interface, adapted for the browser's asynchronous WebHID API. All necessary methods are fully implemented:
+
+-   **`__init__(self, vid, pid, serial_number)`**: Initializes the HID configuration.
+-   **`async setup(self)`**: Handles device discovery and connection. It correctly checks for previously authorized devices and provides a fallback to request a new device, which requires a user gesture. It also sets up listeners for data input and device disconnection.
+-   **`async write(self, data, report_id)`**: Transmits data to the connected HID device. It correctly handles report IDs and formats the payload for the WebHID API.
+-   **`async read(self, size, timeout)`**: Reads data from the device. It uses an `asyncio.Queue` to bridge the event-driven nature of WebHID (`inputreport` events) with the polling `read` method expected by PyLabRobot, including proper timeout handling.
+-   **`async stop(self)`**: Properly closes the device connection and cleans up all event listeners and Pyodide proxies.
+
+## 3. Missing/Stubbed Methods
+
+There are **no missing or stubbed methods** within the `WebHID` class itself.
+
+A minor point of consideration is the global module shim in `pyodide_io_patch.py`:
+-   The `_inject_hid_shim` function creates a placeholder `hid` module in `sys.modules`. This is a fallback to prevent `ImportError` in libraries that might use `import hid` directly. This shim's methods (`device()`, `enumerate()`) are non-functional stubs.
+-   This is a minor issue and does not affect the primary integration with PyLabRobot, which is handled by directly patching the `pylabrobot.io.hid.HID` class.
+
+## 4. Known Issues & Proposed Solutions
+
+**Issue 1: Outdated Technical Debt Document**
+-   **Description**: The file `.agent/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` incorrectly lists the "HID Transport Shim" as "Missing". This creates confusion and could lead to redundant work.
+-   **Proposed Solution**: Update or remove the entry from `.agent/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` to reflect the completed status of the shim.
+
+**Issue 2: Minimal Global `hid` Module Shim**
+-   **Description**: The global `hid` module shim injected by `pyodide_io_patch.py` is a placeholder to prevent import errors and is not functional.
+-   **Proposed Solution**: This is a low-priority issue. If a specific backend is found to rely on `import hid` and calls functions like `hid.enumerate()`, this shim would need to be expanded. For the primary use case of Inheco devices via PyLabRobot, this is not a blocker. No immediate action is required.
+
+## 5. Recommendation: Ship As-Is
+
+The WebHID shim is well-implemented, complete, and appears ready for use in a browser environment. It is not a blocker. The primary issue is documentation, which should be corrected.
+
+**Recommendation: The component is ready to ship. The outdated technical debt entry should be updated.**
