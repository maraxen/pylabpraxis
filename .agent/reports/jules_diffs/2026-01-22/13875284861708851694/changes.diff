+## 4. Screenshot Audit
+
+There are no screenshots in the documentation.
+
+## 5. Update Priorities
+
+1.  **High:** Address all accuracy issues, particularly those related to setup and installation, as they will prevent users from getting started. Remove the duplicate `praxis/web-client/src/assets/docs/` directory.
+2.  **Medium:** Fix the broken links and outdated content. Generate the missing diagrams.
+3.  **Low:** Add screenshots to the documentation to improve clarity.
