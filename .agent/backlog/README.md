# Backlog

> Future work items and ideas not yet in the DEVELOPMENT_MATRIX.

## What Goes Here

Long-term ideas, technical debt notes, and feature requests that aren't ready for the matrix. Organized by category (e.g., `hardware.md`, `features.md`).

## How to Use

1. **Add ideas**: Create/update `.md` files with rough ideas
2. **Promote to matrix**: When ready, create a matrix entry and reference the backlog item
3. **Clean up**: Remove items once they're in the matrix
