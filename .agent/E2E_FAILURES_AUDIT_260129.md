## Root Cause Clusters

### 1. Asset Management Timeouts (HIGH)
- Tests hitting ~30s timeout waiting for UI updates after DB operations
- OPFS logs confirm DB interaction, but UI not receiving/reacting to data
- **Hypothesis:** Race condition between fast OPFS writes and Angular change detection

### 2. Rapid Failures / Cascading Effect (HIGH)
- Large group failing <500ms with "element not found"
- Suggests app in broken state after earlier failure
- **Hypothesis:** Previous test failure leaves app in unrecoverable state

### 3. Complex Workflow Timeouts (LOW)
- Protocol execution (2.1m) and asset wizard (2.0m)
- Deep-seated bugs in multi-step journeys
- **Defer** until foundational issues fixed

### 4. Browser Persistence (MEDIUM)
- Export/import database failing
- May be affected by OPFS changes

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. **Isolate rapid failures** - Run `data-visualization.spec.ts` solo to determine if cascading
2. **Stabilize asset management** - Add detailed logging to trace DB→UI data flow
3. **Defer complex workflows** - Fix foundational issues first
