# Codestyles

> Project-specific coding standards and conventions.

## What Goes Here

Language-specific style guides (e.g., `python.md`, `typescript.md`). These define formatting, naming conventions, and patterns that all code should follow.

## How to Use

1. **Check before coding**: Read the relevant language guide
2. **Match existing patterns**: Follow conventions already in the codebase
3. **Update as needed**: Add new conventions when patterns emerge
