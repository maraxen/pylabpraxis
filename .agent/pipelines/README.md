# Pipelines

> Automation sequences for multi-step processes.

## What Goes Here

Pipeline definitions that chain multiple operations together. Used for complex workflows that need consistent execution order.

## How to Use

1. **Run pipelines**: Execute defined sequences for repeatable processes
2. **Create pipelines**: Define new multi-step automation as needed
3. **Reference in matrix**: Link pipelines in the Workflows column
