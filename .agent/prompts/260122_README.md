## Execution Order

**Recommended sequencing for UI Polish:**

1. **Theme CSS Variable Fixes** (Easy, high impact)
   - Quick wins on Protocol Detail and Settings
   - Establishes pattern for other fixes

2. **Asset Wizard Visual Tweaks** (Easy-Medium)
   - Highly visible component
   - Grid sizing is straightforward

3. **Protocol Runner Visual Tweaks** (Medium)
   - More comprehensive audit needed
   - Core user-facing feature

4. **E2E Test Infrastructure** (Foundation)
   - Enables visual verification for all other work
   - Should be done early to enable testing
