## Summary

The visual audit of the Data Visualization and Playground sections of the Praxis application was unsuccessful due to a persistent database initialization issue that prevented the application from loading. This issue needs to be resolved before a proper visual audit can be conducted.

**Note:** The database initialization issue has since been resolved (Vite prebundle fix for OPFS). A re-audit is recommended.
