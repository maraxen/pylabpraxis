# OPFS + Pyodide Integration Audit

*Jules Session: OPFS-01 (`9221878143682473760`)*
*Date: 2026-01-23*

## Integration Architecture

The integration between Pyodide and the OPFS backend is designed to be indirect, with data being exchanged between the main application and the Pyodide environment through a message-passing system. The `web_bridge.py` script serves as the intermediary, handling all communication between the two environments.

The Pyodide kernel operates in a sandboxed environment and uses its own virtual file system, which is entirely separate from the application's OPFS. This means that Pyodide does not have direct access to the OPFS-backed SQLite database. Instead, data is passed to the Python environment via a messaging system, with `web_bridge.py` handling the communication.

## Test Results

| Scenario | Result | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Create data in the app | ✅ Pass | Created a new asset named "Audit Asset" |
| Access data from Pyodide | ✅ Pass | Accessed the asset from the playground REPL |
| Run a protocol that reads/writes data | ✅ Pass | Ran a protocol that created a new asset named "New Asset from Protocol" |
| Verify persistence after reload | ✅ Pass | Verified that both assets persisted after a page reload |

## Issues Found

No issues were found during the audit. The integration between Pyodide and the OPFS backend is working as expected.

## Recommendations

No recommendations are necessary at this time. The OPFS-Pyodide integration is functioning correctly.
