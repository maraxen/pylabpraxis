"""Dependency Injection container for the Praxis application.

This module defines the dependency injection (DI) container for the entire application.
It uses the `dependency-injector` library to manage object creation and wiring.

For more information on `dependency-injector`, see the documentation:
https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/

class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):

    """Main DI container for the application.

    This container holds the providers for all services, repositories, and configurations.
    Providers are configured with different lifetimes (scopes) depending on their use case.

    Lifetimes:
    - Singleton: A single instance is created and shared throughout the application's lifecycle.
                 Use for objects that are expensive to create or are stateless.
    - Factory: A new instance is created every time the provider is accessed.
               Use for lightweight, stateful objects. This is a "transient" scope.
    - Resource: Manages resources that need setup and teardown, like database sessions.
                This is a form of "scoped" provider.

    Interface Binding:
    To bind an interface (defined with `typing.Protocol`) to a concrete implementation,
    define the provider for the concrete class. Type hints in the dependent classes
    should use the Protocol to enforce the contract.

    Example:
        class IMyService(typing.Protocol):
            def do_something(self) -> str: ...

        class MyService:  # Implicitly implements IMyService
            def do_something(self) -> str:
                return "Hello"

        # In the container:
        my_service = providers.Factory(MyService)

        # In a dependent class:
        class MyConsumer:
            def __init__(self, service: IMyService = Provide[Container.my_service]):
                self.service = service
