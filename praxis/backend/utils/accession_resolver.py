  """Resolve a string or UUID accession to a specific entity's UUID.

  This utility function centralizes the logic for fetching an entity by either its
  unique ID or a user-assigned name, returning the definitive UUID if found.

  Args:
      accession: The UUID or user-assigned name of the entity to resolve.
      db: The async database session.
      get_func: The service function used to get the entity by its UUID.
                      Example: `svc.get_resource`
      get_by_name_func: The service function used to get the entity by its name.
                        Example: `svc.get_resource_by_name`
      entity_type_name: The user-friendly name of the entity type (e.g., "Resource
                        ") used for creating clear error messages.

  Returns:
      The UUID of the found entity.

  Raises:
      ValueError: If an entity cannot be found with the given accession.
      TypeError: If the accession type is invalid.
      RuntimeError: If there is an unexpected error during resolution.
