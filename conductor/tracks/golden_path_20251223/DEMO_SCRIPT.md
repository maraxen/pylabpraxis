**Talking Points:**
*   "Welcome to Praxis. To get started, you'll log in with your credentials."
*   "We support integration with standard identity providers for seamless and secure access."
*   (User enters credentials and logs in)

---

## 2. Select Protocol

**Goal:** User navigates to the protocol library and selects a protocol to run.

**Talking Points:**
*   "After logging in, you land on the dashboard. From here, you can navigate to the Protocol Library."
*   "The library contains all the available protocols, which can be sorted or filtered."
*   "We'll select the 'Serial Dilution' protocol for this demonstration."
*   (User clicks on the 'Serial Dilution' protocol card)

---

## 3. Auto-fill Assets

**Goal:** Configure the protocol run by assigning required assets, using the auto-fill feature.

**Screenshot:**

**Talking Points:**
*   "This is the protocol configuration screen. On the left, you see the required inputs: a plate, a tip rack, and the compound."
*   "Praxis simplifies setup with its 'Auto-fill' feature, which intelligently reserves available assets from the lab's inventory."
*   "Notice how the system has automatically selected a specific plate and tip rack."
*   "We just need to specify the location of our compound."
*   (User manually selects the source well for the compound)

---

## 4. Visualize Deck

**Goal:** User visualizes the deck layout to confirm the physical setup is correct.

**Talking Points:**
*   "Before starting the run, it's crucial to ensure the physical setup matches the digital configuration."
*   "The 'Visualize Deck' feature provides a clear, interactive 2D representation of the robot deck."
*   "You can see the exact placement of the plate and the tip rack, matching the assignments we just made. This confirmation step helps prevent costly errors."

---

## 5. Run

**Goal:** User starts the protocol execution.

**Screenshot:**

**Talking Points:**
*   "With the setup confirmed, we're ready to start the run."
*   (User clicks the "Run" button)
*   "The system now sends the commands to the robot, and the protocol execution begins."
*   "The UI transitions to the 'Live Data' view, where we can monitor the progress in real-time."

---

## 6. See Live Data

**Goal:** Monitor the live progress of the protocol run.

**Screenshot:**

**Talking Points:**
*   "Here, we can see a live feed of the instrument's operations."
*   "Key metrics, such as step completion time and liquid transfer volumes, are updated in real-time."
*   "The event log provides a detailed, step-by-step account of the actions being performed by the robot."

---

## 7. Pause/Resume

**Goal:** Demonstrate the ability to pause and resume a run.

**Screenshot:**

**Talking Points:**
*   "Praxis gives the operator full control during execution. If an issue arises, like needing to refill a reagent, you can pause the run."
*   (User clicks the "Pause" button)
*   "The robot safely halts its current action. Once the issue is resolved, the run can be seamlessly resumed."
*   (User clicks the "Resume" button)
*   "The protocol picks up exactly where it left off."

---

## 8. Finish

**Goal:** The protocol completes, and the user can view the results.

**Screenshot:**

**Talking Points:**
*   "The protocol has now completed successfully."
*   "The final run summary provides an overview of the execution, including total run time and any warnings or errors."
*   "From here, you can export the results, view detailed logs, and mark the run for archival."
*   "This concludes our demonstration of the core workflow in Praxis."
