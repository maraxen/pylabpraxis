# Plan: The "Golden Path" (Demo Content)

## Phase 1: Minimal Implementation (Demo Ready)
*   [ ] Task: Create Demo Protocol `demo_golden_path.py`.
    *   [ ] Subtask: Based on `simple_transfer.py` but tuned for timing (2-3 mins).
    *   [ ] Subtask: Embed "Mock Data Emitters" within the protocol to generate telemetry during the run.
*   [ ] Task: Document the Demo Script.
    *   [ ] Subtask: Write `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` with step-by-step click instructions and talking points.
*   [ ] Task: Dry Run Verification.
    *   [ ] Subtask: Execute the full script 3 times to ensure stability.
*   [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Golden Path Minimal' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Full Implementation
*   [ ] Task: Implement Error Recovery Scenario.
*   [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Golden Path Full' (Protocol in workflow.md)
