\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0 (Inferred from \`backend/\_\_version\_\_.py\`)  
\*\*Last Updated:\*\* June 10, 2024

\#\# 1\. High-Level Project Overview

PylabPraxis is a software platform designed for laboratory automation. It consists of a Python-based backend (housed in the \`backend\` directory) that manages workcells, protocols, and assets, and a Flutter-based frontend (housed in the \`frontend\` directory) for user interaction. The system utilizes Docker for containerization of services, including a Keycloak instance for authentication, a PostgreSQL database, and a Redis instance.

A significant backend refactor is underway, focusing on a decorator-based, function-centric approach for protocol definition, comprehensive database logging of protocol execution, and more robust asset and workcell management.

\*\*Core Technologies:\*\*

\* \*\*Backend:\*\* Python, FastAPI (for REST APIs), SQLAlchemy (for ORM), Pydantic (for data validation).  
\* \*\*Frontend:\*\* Flutter/Dart (details in later chunks).  
\* \*\*Database:\*\* PostgreSQL (for persistent storage of definitions, logs, and asset states).  
\* \*\*State Management/Locking:\*\* Redis (for runtime state, caching, and distributed locking, e.g., \`backend.utils.redis\_lock.py\`).  
\* \*\*Authentication:\*\* Keycloak.  
\* \*\*Containerization:\*\* Docker, Docker Compose.

The backend (formerly "Praxis," now in the \`backend\` directory) serves as the central system for:  
\* \*\*Protocol Definition & Discovery:\*\* Using a decorator-based system (\`@protocol\_function\`) to define protocols as Python functions. A \`ProtocolDiscoveryService\` scans code, extracts metadata, and stores definitions in the database.  
\* \*\*Orchestration:\*\* Managing the execution of these protocols, including state (\`PraxisState\`, \`PraxisRunContext\`), parameter handling, and interaction with the workcell.  
\* \*\*Asset Management:\*\* Tracking physical (labware, devices) and logical assets.  
\* \*\*Workcell Interaction:\*\* Managing live PyLabRobot objects representing instruments and labware on the deck.  
\* \*\*Data Logging:\*\* Persistently logging protocol definitions, individual function calls within a run, and overall run status to the PostgreSQL database.

It exposes a REST API via FastAPI for the Flutter frontend.

\#\# 2\. Python Backend (\`backend\` Package) \- Core Components

The Python backend logic is now contained within the \`backend\` directory and its submodules (e.g., \`backend.core\`, \`backend.api\`).

\*\*Entry Point (\`main.py\` at the root of the project, interacting with the \`backend\` package):\*\*

\* Initializes the FastAPI application.  
\* Sets up logging (from \`praxis.ini\` \- \*Note: config file name might also change, e.g., to \`backend.ini\` or remain \`praxis.ini\` if it's a general project config\*).  
\* Loads application settings using \`backend.configure.get\_settings()\`.  
\* Initializes database engine and session factory (\`backend.utils.db.init\_db()\`).  
\* Initializes core services like \`WorkcellRuntime\`, \`AssetManager\`, and \`ProtocolDiscoveryService\` (which populates an in-memory \`PROTOCOL\_REGISTRY\` with database IDs of discovered protocols).  
\* Includes API routers from \`backend.api.\*\`.  
\* Handles application startup (\`startup\_event\` for service initialization and protocol discovery) and shutdown events (\`shutdown\_event\` for cleanup).

\*\*Configuration (\`praxis.ini\` or equivalent, \`backend/configure.py\`):\*\*

\* Configuration file (e.g., \`praxis.ini\`): Main configuration file for the backend. Contains settings for:  
    \* Database connection (\`sqlalchemy.url\`)  
    \* Redis connection (\`redis\_host\`, \`redis\_port\`)  
    \* Logging levels and handlers  
    \* Paths for deck layouts, protocol definitions, labware definitions.  
    \* Keycloak settings (\`keycloak\_server\_url\`, \`keycloak\_realm\`, \`keycloak\_client\_id\`)  
    \* Workcell configuration (e.g., \`workcell\_config\_path\`)  
\* \`backend/configure.py\`:  
    \* \`Settings\` class (Pydantic \`BaseSettings\`): Loads configurations from environment variables and the INI file.  
    \* \`get\_settings()\`: Provides a cached instance of the \`Settings\`.

\#\#\# 2.1. \`backend.core\` \- The Heart of the Backend

This module contains the fundamental logic for managing and operating the laboratory workcell.

\#\#\#\# 2.1.1. \`Workcell\` (\`backend/core/workcell.py\`)

\* \*\*Purpose:\*\* Represents the physical laboratory workcell, including its instruments. (Role might be evolving with \`WorkcellRuntime\` taking more dynamic control of PyLabRobot objects).  
\* \*\*Key Classes:\*\*  
    \* \`Workcell\`:  
        \* Manages a collection of instrument drivers (potentially less direct management post-refactor, with \`WorkcellRuntime\` handling PyLabRobot instances).  
        \* Loads static workcell configuration.  
\* \*\*TODOs (from original analysis, context may change with refactor):\*\*  
    \* \`\# TODO: Add more sophisticated error handling and recovery for driver initialization.\`  
    \* \`\# TODO: Implement dynamic loading/unloading of drivers if needed in the future.\` (Partially addressed by \`WorkcellRuntime\`'s dynamic instantiation).

    \* \`\_\_init\_\_(self, config\_path: str, settings: Settings)\`  
    \* \`initialize\_drivers(self)\`  
    \* \`get\_driver(self, name: str)\`

\#\#\#\# 2.1.2. \`WorkcellRuntime\` (\`backend/core/workcell\_runtime.py\`) (Refactored Role)

\* \*\*Purpose (Refactored):\*\* Manages live PyLabRobot objects (backends, resources) by translating database representations (from \`AssetManager\`) into operational instances. Dynamically instantiates PLR backends and labware resources using their fully qualified Python class paths (FQNs). (Core instantiation logic implemented and refined).
\* \*\*Key Responsibilities:\*\*  
    \* Holds the live \`Workcell\` instance and its PyLabRobot instrument/resource objects.  
    \* Manages the overall state of the workcell (\`WorkcellState\` enum: \`OFFLINE\`, \`ONLINE\`, \`INITIALIZING\`, \`IDLE\`, \`RUNNING\`, \`PAUSED\`, \`ERROR\`, \`MAINTENANCE\`).  
    \* Handles dynamic instantiation (using FQNs), initialization, and shutdown of PyLabRobot backends and labware. Corrected FQN handling for labware (using `python_fqn` from `LabwareDefinitionCatalogOrm`) is implemented.
    \* Provides methods for device actions (\`execute\_device\_action\`).

    \* \`create_or_get_labware_plr_object(labware_definition: LabwareDefinitionCatalogOrm, labware_instance: Optional[LabwareInstanceOrm] = None) -> Resource\` (Takes FQN from `labware_definition`, updates DB status via `asset_data_service`).
    \* \`assign\_labware\_to\_deck\_slot(deck\_slot, plr\_labware\_object)\`  
    \* \`get\_instrument(self, instrument\_name: str)\`

\#\#\#\# 2.1.3. \`Orchestrator\` (\`backend/core/orchestrator.py\`) (Refactored Role)

    \* Fetches protocol definitions (now \`FunctionProtocolDefinitionOrm\`) from the database via \`ProtocolDataService\`.  
    \* Prepares the execution environment (e.g., code checkout from Git for \`ProtocolSourceRepositoryOrm\`, \`sys.path\` management).  
    \* Manages a canonical \`PraxisState\` object for each top-level run. (Implemented).
    \* Prepares arguments for protocol functions, including state (\`PraxisState\` object or a dict copy) and placeholder assets (resolved by the refined \`AssetManager\`). JSONSchema-based parameter validation using refactored \`jsonschema_utils.py\` is integrated.
    \* Initializes and passes a \`PraxisRunContext\` to the top-level protocol's wrapper. This context carries run identifiers (\`run\_guid\`), the DB session, canonical state, and call hierarchy information. (Implemented).
    \* Ensures the \`db\_id\` of the top-level protocol definition is available in its metadata for the decorator wrapper (used for logging).  
    \* Handles overall run status logging to \`ProtocolRunOrm\` (e.g., start/end times, status, inputs/outputs, state snapshots).  
    \* Interacts with the refined \`AssetManager\` to acquire/release assets during protocol execution. (Basic integration for acquiring/releasing assets is functional).
\* \*\*TODOs:\*\*  
    \* \`# TODO: ORCH-1: Integrate AssetManager\` (Significantly progressed: Basic integration for acquiring/releasing assets is functional via refined `AssetManager`)

# **PylabPraxis Codebase Documentation \- Part 2: Python Backend Protocols & Utilities (Revised V4)**

Version: 0.1.0 (Inferred from backend/\_\_version\_\_.py)

Last Updated: June 10, 2024

This document details the refactored protocol definition and execution system in PylabPraxis, focusing on the backend.protocol\_core, backend.protocol, backend.commons, and backend.utils modules. The refactor emphasizes a decorator-based, function-centric approach for enhanced flexibility, metadata extraction, and detailed logging.

## **1\. The Refactored Protocol System: Function-Based & Decorator-Driven**

The PylabPraxis backend (now in the backend/ directory) has moved towards defining laboratory protocols as Python functions, heavily utilizing decorators for metadata attachment, context management, and execution logging. This approach replaces or significantly augments any previous class-based protocol structures.

Key Goals & Benefits of the Refactor:

* Enhanced Flexibility & Extensibility: Defining protocols as functions makes them easier to write, combine, and reuse.  
* Rich Metadata Extraction: Decorators allow for explicit declaration of protocol name, version, description, parameters (including UI hints and constraints), required assets, operational constraints, and more, directly in the code. This metadata is then captured and stored in the database. Functions without decorators can also be discovered and treated as protocols, though with less explicit metadata.  
* Comprehensive Call-Tree Logging: Every call to a decorated protocol function during a run is logged to the database (FunctionCallLogOrm), including its arguments, return values, timing, and hierarchical relationship to parent calls. This provides a detailed audit trail.  
* Improved State Management: A canonical PraxisState object is managed per run, utilizing Redis for runtime in-memory access and persistence. Clear rules govern how it's passed to and potentially modified by protocol functions.  
* Broader Developmental Applicability: The functional approach with clear metadata and context management simplifies integration and makes the system more approachable for developers creating new protocols.  
* Multiple Invocation Methods: Supports protocol execution via frontend (passing JSON parameters) and command-line/manual submission (requiring ProtocolConfig\-like structures).

## **2\.** backend.protocol\_core **\- Engine of the New Protocol System**

This module provides the core components for defining, discovering, and managing the execution context of the new function-based protocols.

### **2.1.** backend.protocol\_core.decorators

This module is central to the new protocol system.

* @protocol\_function(...) Decorator:  
  * Purpose: This is the primary decorator used to designate a Python function as a PylabPraxis protocol or a sub-step within a larger protocol, allowing for rich metadata specification.  
  * Key Parameters (as specified in the "Backend Refactor" document):  
    1. name: str: User-defined name for the protocol function.  
    2. version: str: Version string for the protocol function.  
    3. description: str: A human-readable description.  
    4. parameters: Optional\[Dict\[str, Type\]\]: (Likely inferred from type hints and param\_metadata now) Defines expected parameters. Type hints in the function signature (e.g., param\_name: int, state: PraxisState, state\_dict: dict) are crucial.  
    5. param\_metadata: Optional\[Dict\[str, Dict\[str, Any\]\]\]: Additional metadata for parameters (e.g., descriptions, constraints, UI hints).  
    6. assets: Optional\[List\[Union\[str, AssetRequirement\]\]\]: Declares required assets (devices, labware). *This is evolving: asset requirements will increasingly be inferred from function argument type hints (e.g., pipette: Optional\[Pipette\], plate1: Plate) specifying PLR resources/machines.*  
    7. constraints: Optional\[Dict\[str, Any\]\]: Defines operational constraints.  
    8. is\_top\_level: bool \= False: Flag indicating if this function can be initiated as a top-level protocol run.  
    9. solo\_execution: bool \= False: Flag indicating if this protocol requires exclusive access to the workcell.  
    10. preconfigure\_deck: bool \= False: Flag indicating if the deck should be preconfigured according to a specific layout before this protocol runs.  
    11. state\_param\_name: Optional\[str\] \= "state": Specifies the name of the parameter that will receive the PraxisState object (if type-hinted as PraxisState) or a dictionary copy.  
  * Functionality:  
    1. Metadata Extraction: At import time (during discovery), the decorator inspects the decorated function and its arguments, collecting all provided metadata. This metadata is structured into Pydantic models (e.g., `FunctionProtocolDefinitionModel`). (Completed)
    2. Execution Wrapping: It returns a wrapper around the original function. When this wrapper is called by the Orchestrator:  
       * It receives a `PraxisRunContext`.
       * It includes stubs for logging its own execution details (start time, arguments, etc.) to `FunctionCallLogOrm`, using its `protocol_metadata['db_id']` (the database ID of its definition) and the `parent_function_call_log_id` from the `PraxisRunContext`. (Logging stubs implemented, full logging pending).
       * It prepares arguments for the original user-written function, including injecting the PraxisState or its dictionary copy, and resolved asset instances.  
       * It calls the original function.  
       * It logs the result (return value or exception) and end time to FunctionCallLogOrm.  
       * It ensures that if the original function calls other @protocol\_function decorated functions, a new PraxisRunContext with updated parentage is passed down, maintaining the call hierarchy.

### **2.2.** backend.protocol\_core.definitions

This module defines key data structures used throughout the protocol execution lifecycle.

* PraxisState Class:  
  * Purpose: A canonical, mutable object that holds the shared state for a single top-level protocol run. This can include experimental parameters, intermediate results, tracking information for shared resources, etc.  
  * Implementation: It is implemented and utilizes a Redis cache (via `RedisStateCache`) for runtime in-memory access and persistence of state during a protocol run. (Completed)
  * Structure: A Pydantic model allowing for structured data storage and access. It can be extended or customized per protocol needs.
  * Management by Orchestrator:  
    * An instance is created for each top-level run, potentially initialized from Redis if resuming.  
    * If a `@protocol_function` is type-hinted to receive `PraxisState` (e.g., `def my_func(state: PraxisState):`), the Orchestrator passes this canonical instance directly. Modifications by the function persist and are reflected in Redis.
    * If a function is type-hinted to receive `dict` for state (e.g., `def my_func(state_dict: dict):`), the Orchestrator provides a deep copy of the relevant parts of `PraxisState`. For top-level protocols expecting a `dict`, changes might be merged back into the canonical `PraxisState` by the Orchestrator. For nested functions expecting `dict` state, they receive a fresh copy to prevent unintended side effects on sibling or parent states.
* PraxisRunContext Class:  
  * Purpose: An immutable object passed through the call stack of `@protocol_function` calls within a single top-level run. It carries essential information for execution and logging. (Implemented and in use).
  * Key Attributes:  
    * run\_guid: UUID: The unique identifier for the top-level ProtocolRunOrm.  
    * protocol\_run\_db\_id: int: The database ID of the ProtocolRunOrm.  
    * function\_definition\_db\_id: int: The database ID of the currently executing FunctionProtocolDefinitionOrm.  
    * parent\_function\_call\_log\_id: Optional\[int\]: The database ID of the FunctionCallLogOrm entry for the calling function (None for top-level calls).  
    * db\_session: Session: The SQLAlchemy session for database interactions within the protocol function (e.g., for the wrapper to log).  
    * canonical\_state: PraxisState: The canonical PraxisState object for the current run.  
    * Other relevant identifiers or utility objects.  
  * Propagation: The `@protocol_function` wrapper is responsible for creating and passing a new, updated `PraxisRunContext` (with the correct `parent_function_call_log_id`) when calling nested user code that might itself contain calls to other decorated protocol functions.
* Pydantic Models (e.g., `FunctionProtocolDefinitionModel` from `backend.protocol_core.protocol_definition_models.py`):
  * These models are used by the `ProtocolDiscoveryService` to structure the metadata extracted by the `@protocol_function` decorator (or inferred for undecorated functions) before it's persisted to the database via `ProtocolDataService`. They ensure data consistency and validation. (Implemented and in use by Discovery Service and ProtocolDataService).

### **2.3.** backend.protocol\_core.discovery\_service

* ProtocolDiscoveryService Class:  
  * Purpose: Responsible for finding, parsing, and registering protocol definitions within the PylabPraxis system. (Refactored and operational).
  * Workflow:  
    1. Scanning Sources: Scans Python code from configured sources (e.g., Git repositories, local filesystem paths, including arbitrary directories containing Python files).  
    2. Metadata Extraction & Inference:  
       * For functions decorated with `@protocol_function`, it directly uses the rich metadata provided.
       * For undecorated functions in discoverable Python files, it attempts to infer basic protocol information (e.g., name from function name, parameters from signature), using Pydantic models for structuring. These will have less explicit metadata unless defaults are applied.
    3. Pydantic Conversion: The collected/inferred metadata is converted into structured Pydantic models (e.g., `FunctionProtocolDefinitionModel`).
    4. Database Upsertion: Uses `ProtocolDataService` (which now consumes these Pydantic models) to "upsert" these protocol definitions into the `FunctionProtocolDefinitionOrm` table.
    5. In-Memory Registry Update: Updates an in-memory `PROTOCOL_REGISTRY` mapping a unique protocol identifier to its `db_id`.

## **3\. Defining Protocols (**backend.protocol **and** backend.protocol.protocols**)**

This section describes how developers write protocols using the new system.

* Protocol Structure:  
  * Protocols are Python functions, ideally decorated with @protocol\_function for full feature support.  
  * Organized into modules, typically within backend/protocol/protocols/.  
* Parameters:  
  * Defined using standard Python function arguments with type hints.  
  * Metadata (UI hints, constraints) can be provided via param\_metadata in the decorator.  
  * State parameters: Type hint as PraxisState or dict.  
  * For frontend invocation, parameters are typically passed as JSON and unpacked into function arguments by the backend.  
  * For command-line/manual execution, ProtocolConfig\-like data structures (see backend.protocol.config.py below) will be used to gather and supply these arguments.  
* Asset Declaration (Evolving):  
  * Previously declared via assets argument in decorator or backend.protocol.required\_assets.py.  
  * New Approach: Asset requirements (PLR resources like Pipette, Plate, specific machine instances) will be primarily inferred from function argument type hints.  
    * Example: def my\_protocol\_step(pipette: Pipette, source\_plate: Plate, target\_plate: Optional\[Plate\]): ...  
    * The Orchestrator and AssetManager will use these type hints to identify and acquire the necessary PLR objects. Optional hints indicate non-mandatory assets.  
  * backend.protocol.required\_assets.py: Its role will diminish significantly or be deprecated, as type hinting becomes the primary mechanism.  
* Nested Calls & is\_top\_level:  
  * Protocols can call other @protocol\_function decorated functions, with PraxisRunContext ensuring hierarchical logging.  
  * is\_top\_level=True in the decorator marks functions callable as complete protocol runs. Undecorated functions discovered might default to is\_top\_level=False or require explicit configuration.  
* backend.protocol.parameter.py:  
  * Contains classes like Parameter, IntegerParameter, etc. Their role is likely reduced with Pydantic models and type hinting, but they might still be used by jsonschema\_utils.py or for generating UI elements if param\_metadata doesn't cover all needs.  
* backend.protocol.jsonschema\_utils.py:  
  * Purpose: This utility is responsible for converting protocol parameter definitions (derived from Pydantic models created from decorator metadata and type hints) into JSONSchema. (This utility has been refactored and is integrated with the Orchestrator for parameter validation).
  * Usage: The generated JSONSchema is crucial for the FastAPI backend. It is used by the API layer (specifically endpoints in `backend.api.protocols`) to validate the structure and types of incoming parameter payloads when a protocol run is requested from the frontend or other clients. This ensures that user-provided parameters conform to the protocol's expectations before execution begins, preventing runtime errors due to mismatched data.
* backend.protocol.config.py:  
  * Legacy Role: Currently contains a ProtocolConfig class that is loaded by the older Protocol class structure.  
  * Future Role: This module will likely evolve to define Pydantic models or data structures that represent the configuration needed to run a protocol, especially for command-line invocation or manual runs. These structures would capture parameters, target state, and potentially notification preferences, replacing direct loading into a class instance. For frontend-driven runs, parameters will primarily come from JSON payloads.  
* backend.protocol.standalone\_task.py (StandaloneTask class):  
  * Status: To be deprecated.  
  * The functionality of defining and running self-contained tasks will be absorbed by the @protocol\_function mechanism. Parallel execution concerns on the same workcell are intended to be better managed by the Orchestrator and resource locking (e.g., via RedisLock).

### **3.1. Transitioning from** backend.protocol.protocol.Protocol **(Legacy Class-Based Approach)**

The refactor aims to migrate core functionalities of any older class-based protocol system:

* Directory and README Generation: Metadata is now database-centric. Documentation can be generated from DB or source code. Run-specific directory creation is an Orchestrator/logging concern.  
* Data Management: PraxisState (Redis-backed), DB logging (ProtocolRunOrm, FunctionCallLogOrm), and AssetManager provide robust data handling.  
* Bespoke State Tracking: PraxisState and detailed FunctionCallLogOrm offer structured state tracking.  
* Parameter Definition: Primarily via function signatures, type hints, and decorator metadata.

## **4\.** backend.commons **\- Reusable Laboratory Operations**

This package contains modules with pre-built, reusable functions for common lab tasks.

* Current Status: Can be largely ignored for the initial refactoring documentation focus.  
* Future Potential: Functions within these modules are candidates to be wrapped with @protocol\_function to become discoverable protocol steps or to be used by a future frontend interface for visually stringing together protocols.  
* Modules: liquid\_handling.py, dilution.py, plate\_staging.py, plate\_reading.py, tip\_staging.py, overrides.py, commons.py.

## **5\.** backend.utils **\- General Utilities**

* logging.py: Application-wide logging configuration.  
* errors.py: Custom application-specific exception classes.  
* state.py (State class, Stateful mixin):  
  * Relationship to PraxisState: PraxisState (from backend.protocol\_core.definitions) is the primary state management object for protocol runs and should implement or leverage a similar Redis-backed approach for runtime state management and persistence as potentially demonstrated in backend.utils.state.State. The goal is for PraxisState to be the definitive, Redis-integrated state mechanism for protocols.  
* schemas.py: General Pydantic models.  
* sanitation.py: Data cleaning and validation utilities.  
* redis\_lock.py: Distributed lock implementation using Redis.  
* plr\_inspection.py (PLRInspector):  
  * Utility for introspecting PyLabRobot.  
  * Status: Needs significant work to reliably gather information for AssetManager.sync\_pylabrobot\_definitions().  
* notify.py:  
  * Purpose: Contains utilities for sending notifications (e.g., email, text messages), previously used by the Protocol class.  
  * Future Role: This notification functionality will be retained. Notification preferences and details (e.g., recipient emails/numbers) will likely be passed as parameters from the frontend or configured within the ProtocolConfig\-like structures for manual/CLI runs, with the Orchestrator or a dedicated notification service invoking these utilities.  
* db.py: Database setup (covered in Chunk 1).

## **6\. Priorities & TODOs (Chunk 2 Scope \- Revised)**

* Critical Priority:  
  * Solidify @protocol\_function Decorator & ProtocolDiscoveryService:  
    * Ensure robust metadata extraction (for decorated functions) and inference (for undecorated functions from arbitrary Python files/directories). (Largely complete, Pydantic models used).
    * Fully test context propagation (PraxisRunContext) and logging to FunctionCallLogOrm. (PraxisRunContext implemented, logging stubs in place, full logging pending).
    * Verify ProtocolDiscoveryService for correct scanning, DB upsertion, and PROTOCOL_REGISTRY updates. (Core functionality complete and verified).
  * Implement PraxisState with Redis Integration: Finalize PraxisState design, ensuring it uses Redis for runtime state management and persistence, and clarify its handling by the Orchestrator. (Complete and Integrated).
* High Priority:  
  * Asset Requirement Inference: Implement logic in Orchestrator/AssetManager to infer asset needs from function type hints (PLR resources/machines, Optional handling). Deprecate/refactor backend.protocol.required\_assets.py.  
  * Parameter Handling for Multiple Invocation Paths:  
    * Implement JSON unpacking for frontend-driven runs.  
    * Define and implement ProtocolConfig\-like Pydantic models in/near backend.protocol.config.py for CLI/manual runs.  
  * Integrate backend.protocol.jsonschema\_utils.py: For API validation of parameters. Ensure its output is correctly used by FastAPI for validating incoming protocol parameters. (Complete).
  * Deprecate backend.protocol.standalone\_task.py.  
  * Develop Example Protocols: Using the new system, covering various scenarios.  
* Medium Priority:  
  * Clarify/Refactor backend.protocol.parameter.py: Determine its final role.  
  * Refine backend.utils.notify.py: Adapt for parameter-driven notification details.  
  * Address backend.utils.plr\_inspection.py: Plan and begin improvements. (Partially addressed by `python_fqn` usage in `LabwareDefinitionCatalogOrm`).
* Documentation:  
  * Update backend/protocol/README.md to reflect the new decorator-based system and JSONSchema validation process. (Partially addressed by this ROADMAP update).

This chunk details the shift towards a more modern, flexible, and observable protocol system, which is key for broader developmental applicability and robust operation.

# **PylabPraxis Codebase Documentation \- Part 3: Flutter Frontend Core Architecture & Services**

Version: (Frontend version usually aligns with pubspec.yaml)

Last Updated: May 22, 2025

This document outlines the core architecture and services of the PylabPraxis Flutter application, located in the frontend/ directory. It covers the application's entry point, navigation, theming, networking, data handling layers (models, repositories, services), and core functionalities like authentication.

## **1\. Frontend Project Overview**

The PylabPraxis frontend is a Flutter application designed to provide a user interface for interacting with the Python backend. It allows users to manage protocols, assets, configure runs, and monitor workcell operations.

Key Technologies & Libraries (from frontend/pubspec.yaml):

* Core: Flutter SDK, Dart.  
* State Management: flutter\_bloc (BLoC pattern for managing application state).  
* Navigation: go\_router (for declarative routing).  
* Networking: dio (for HTTP requests to the backend API).  
* Data Serialization/Deserialization: json\_serializable, freezed (for generating boilerplate for data models).  
* Authentication: openid\_client (for OIDC-based authentication with Keycloak), flutter\_secure\_storage (for securely storing tokens).  
* UI: flutter\_hooks (for managing widget lifecycle and state more concisely), various UI utility packages.  
* Dependency Injection: get\_it (service locator pattern).  
* Logging: logging package.

Directory Structure (Key areas within frontend/lib/):

* main.dart: Application entry point.  
* src/: Contains the core source code.  
  * core/: Application-wide utilities, base classes, and configurations.  
    * network/: Networking setup (DioClient).  
    * routing/: Navigation setup (AppGoRouter).  
    * theme/: Application theme (AppTheme).  
    * widgets/: Common reusable widgets (e.g., AppShell).  
    * error/: Custom exceptions and error handling.  
  * data/: Data layer.  
    * models/: Pydantic-like data models (using freezed and json\_serializable) representing entities from the backend (e.g., ProtocolInfo, UserProfile, ApiError).  
    * repositories/: Abstract interfaces for data operations, implemented by concrete classes that use services.  
    * services/: Concrete implementations for interacting with data sources (primarily the backend API via DioClient and OIDC for auth).  
  * features/: Feature-specific modules, each typically containing its own BLoCs, presentation (screens/widgets), and domain logic. (Details in Chunk 4).  
  * app.dart: (Likely contains the root MaterialApp widget and BLoC providers).

## **2\. Application Entry Point & Core Setup**

* frontend/lib/main.dart:  
  * Purpose: Initializes the application, sets up service locators, and runs the main app widget.  
  * Key Actions:  
    * void main(): The primary entry point.  
    * Likely initializes GetIt for dependency injection, registering services like DioClient, AuthService, ProtocolApiService, and various BLoCs.  
    * Sets up logging.  
    * Runs the root application widget (e.g., MyApp or similar, which would be defined in app.dart or main.dart itself).  
* Root Application Widget (e.g., MyApp):  
  * Likely configures MaterialApp.router using go\_router.  
  * Provides global BLoC providers (MultiBlocProvider) for application-wide states (e.g., AuthBloc).  
  * Applies the application theme (AppTheme.light() or AppTheme.dark()).

## **3\. Core Application Components (**frontend/lib/src/core/**)**

### **3.1. Navigation (**frontend/lib/src/core/routing/app\_go\_router.dart**)**

* AppGoRouter Class (or similar setup):  
  * Purpose: Configures all application routes using the go\_router package.  
  * Key Features:  
    * Defines a list of GoRoute objects, mapping paths (e.g., /login, /home, /protocols/:id) to specific screen widgets.  
    * Handles route parameters.  
    * Manages navigation guards/redirects (e.g., redirecting unauthenticated users to /login from protected routes). This is often integrated with the AuthBloc state.  
    * Defines shell routes using ShellRoute for persistent UI elements like a navigation bar or drawer (e.g., AppShell).  
* AppShell Widget (frontend/lib/src/core/widgets/app\_shell.dart):  
  * Purpose: Provides a consistent layout structure for screens that share common UI elements (e.g., a navigation bar, app bar).  
  * Used as the builder for a ShellRoute in go\_router configuration.  
  * Contains the logic for displaying the main navigation elements and the child navigator for the current route.

### **3.2. Theming (**frontend/lib/src/core/theme/app\_theme.dart**)**

* AppTheme Class:  
  * Purpose: Defines the visual styling of the application, including colors, typography, and component themes.  
  * Key Elements:  
    * Static methods like light() and dark() that return ThemeData objects.  
    * Defines primary colors, accent colors, text styles, button themes, input decoration themes, etc.  
    * Ensures a consistent look and feel across the application.

### **3.3. Networking (**frontend/lib/src/core/network/dio\_client.dart**)**

* DioClient Class (or similar HTTP client wrapper):  
  * Purpose: Centralizes HTTP request logic using the dio package.  
  * Key Features:  
    * Configures a Dio instance with base URL (for the backend API), timeouts, and headers.  
    * Includes interceptors for:  
      * Authentication: Automatically attaching JWT access tokens (obtained from AuthService) to outgoing requests.  
      * Token Refresh: Handling token expiry and attempting to refresh tokens if necessary (often in coordination with AuthService).  
      * Logging: Logging request and response details for debugging.  
      * Error Handling: Parsing API errors (e.g., from ApiError model) and converting them into structured exceptions (ServerException, NetworkException from frontend/lib/src/core/error/exceptions.dart).  
    * Provides generic methods for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.  
  * Likely registered with GetIt for easy access from services and repositories.

### **3.4. Error Handling (**frontend/lib/src/core/error/exceptions.dart**)**

* Custom Exception Classes:  
  * ServerException: Represents errors returned by the backend API (e.g., 4xx, 5xx status codes with an error message). Often includes the parsed ApiError from the backend.  
  * CacheException: Represents errors related to local data storage/caching.  
  * NetworkException: Represents network connectivity issues.  
  * AuthenticationException: Represents errors during the authentication process.  
  * Other specific exceptions as needed.  
  * These custom exceptions help in providing more granular error handling and user feedback within BLoCs and UI layers.

## **4\. Data Layer (**frontend/lib/src/data/**)**

This layer is responsible for fetching, storing, and managing data for the application.

### **4.1. Data Models (**frontend/lib/src/data/models/**)**

* Purpose: Represent the structure of data exchanged with the backend API and used within the application.  
* Implementation:  
  * Defined as Dart classes, typically using the freezed package for immutable data classes and json\_serializable for generating fromJson/toJson methods. This allows for easy conversion between Dart objects and JSON.  
  * Key Model Categories:  
    * user/user\_profile.dart: Represents the authenticated user's profile.  
    * protocol/: Contains numerous models related to protocols, mirroring the backend's Pydantic models:  
      * protocol\_info.dart: Basic information about a protocol.  
      * protocol\_details.dart: Detailed information, including parameters, assets, steps.  
      * parameter\_config.dart, parameter\_constraints.dart, parameter\_group.dart: Describe protocol parameters.  
      * protocol\_asset.dart, labware\_definition.dart, deck\_layout.dart: Describe assets and deck configurations.  
      * protocol\_prepare\_request.dart: Model for sending protocol preparation requests.  
      * protocol\_status\_response.dart: Model for receiving protocol run status.  
      * protocol\_step.dart: Represents a step within a protocol.  
    * common/api\_error.dart: Represents a standardized error structure from the backend API.  
* These models are used by services for API communication and by BLoCs and UI layers for displaying data.  
* Many models have associated .freezed.dart (generated by freezed) and .g.dart (generated by json\_serializable) files.

### **4.2. Repositories (**frontend/lib/src/data/repositories/**)**

* Purpose: Define abstract interfaces for data operations. They decouple the application's business logic (in BLoCs/Usecases) from the concrete data sources.  
* Implementation:  
  * Typically defined as abstract classes or interfaces.  
  * Examples:  
    * AuthRepository (auth\_repository.dart): Defines methods like login(), logout(), getUserProfile(), getAuthStateStream().  
    * ProtocolRepository (protocol\_repository.dart): Defines methods like getProtocols(), getProtocolDetails(String id), startProtocolRun(String id, Map\<String, dynamic\> parameters), getProtocolRunStatus(String runId).  
* Concrete implementations of these repositories are usually provided within the same directory or a subdirectory and depend on services from frontend/lib/src/data/services/.  
* Registered with GetIt and injected into BLoCs or Usecases.

### **4.3. Services (**frontend/lib/src/data/services/**)**

* Purpose: Provide concrete implementations for fetching and manipulating data, usually by interacting with external sources like the backend API or secure storage.  
* Key Services:  
  * Authentication Services:  
    * AuthService (auth\_service.dart): Abstract interface for authentication operations.  
    * AuthServiceImpl (auth\_service\_impl.dart): Concrete implementation of AuthService.  
      * Uses OIDCAuthenticator for OIDC flow.  
      * Manages user sessions, stores/retrieves tokens (likely using flutter\_secure\_storage).  
      * Interacts with the backend API (via DioClient) to fetch user profiles after authentication.  
    * OIDCAuthenticator (oidc/oidc\_authenticator.dart): Abstract interface for OIDC operations.  
    * OIDCAuthenticatorWrapper (oidc/oidc\_authenticator\_wrapper.dart): Provides a concrete implementation of OIDCAuthenticator by conditionally importing platform-specific implementations:  
      * OIDCAuthenticatorBrowser (oidc/oidc\_authenticator\_browser.dart): For web platforms.  
      * OIDCAuthenticatorIO (oidc/oidc\_authenticator\_io.dart): For mobile/desktop platforms (uses flutter\_appauth or similar).  
      * OIDCAuthenticatorUnsupported (oidc/oidc\_authenticator\_unsupported.dart): Fallback for unsupported platforms.  
    * The OIDC setup involves configuring client ID, redirect URIs, discovery URL (for Keycloak), and scopes. The frontend/web/auth-callback.html is used for the OIDC redirect flow on the web.  
  * Protocol API Service:  
    * ProtocolApiService (protocol\_api\_service.dart): Abstract interface for protocol-related API calls.  
    * ProtocolApiServiceImpl (protocol\_api\_service\_impl.dart): Concrete implementation.  
      * Uses the DioClient to make HTTP requests to the backend's protocol endpoints (e.g., /protocols, /runs).  
      * Handles serialization/deserialization of request/response bodies using the models from frontend/lib/src/data/models/protocol/.  
* Services are typically registered with GetIt and injected into repository implementations.

## **5\. State Management (BLoC Pattern)**

While the specifics of each feature's BLoCs will be covered in Chunk 4, the general approach is evident:

* flutter\_bloc is used extensively. Each feature typically has one or more BLoCs responsible for managing its state and handling business logic.  
* BLoC Structure:  
  * Events: Represent user actions or external triggers (e.g., LoadProtocolsEvent, LoginButtonPressedEvent).  
  * States: Represent the UI state (e.g., ProtocolsLoadingState, ProtocolsLoadedState, AuthAuthenticatedState, AuthErrorState). States are often defined using freezed for immutability.  
  * BLoC Class: Contains the business logic, listens to events, interacts with repositories/services, and emits new states.  
* BLoCs are provided to the widget tree using BlocProvider and consumed by UI components using BlocBuilder, BlocListener, or BlocConsumer.

## **6\. TODOs & Priorities (Chunk 3 Scope)**

* High Priority:  
  * Stabilize Authentication Flow: Ensure OIDC authentication (OIDCAuthenticator implementations for all target platforms) is robust, including token storage, refresh mechanisms, and handling of various auth states in AuthBloc.  
  * Complete Core API Service Implementations: Ensure ProtocolApiServiceImpl and any other critical API services have full coverage for necessary backend endpoints, including robust error handling and data parsing.  
  * Refine Data Models: Verify that all frontend data models (frontend/lib/src/data/models/) accurately reflect the backend API schemas and support all required UI displays. Ensure fromJson/toJson are correctly implemented and tested.  
* Medium Priority:  
  * Review go\_router Configuration: Ensure all routes, including shell routes and navigation guards, are correctly implemented and cover all application navigation scenarios.  
  * Test DioClient Interceptors: Thoroughly test token attachment, refresh logic, and error parsing in DioClient.  
  * Standardize Error Handling in UI: Establish a consistent pattern for how BLoCs and UI components handle and display errors originating from services/repositories (using custom exceptions from frontend/lib/src/core/error/exceptions.dart).  
* Low Priority (for initial alpha, but important long-term):  
  * Implement comprehensive local caching strategies (beyond token storage) if performance requires it.  
  * Expand UI theming for more granular control and potential dark/light mode improvements.  
  * Add more sophisticated logging for frontend events and state changes.

This chunk provides an overview of the Flutter frontend's foundational elements. The next chunk will delve into specific features within frontend/lib/src/features/.

# **PylabPraxis Codebase Documentation \- Part 4: Flutter Frontend Features & UI (Revised)**

Version: (Frontend version usually aligns with pubspec.yaml)

Last Updated: May 22, 2025

This document delves into the feature-specific modules of the PylabPraxis Flutter application, located within the frontend/lib/src/features/ directory. It examines the structure, BLoC architecture (Events, States, BLoC logic), key screens/widgets, and domain logic for each primary feature, with a particular focus on the run\_protocol workflow.

## **1\. Feature Module Structure Overview**

The frontend/lib/src/features/ directory organizes the application into distinct functional areas. Each feature typically follows a standard structure:

* application/: Contains the BLoCs (Business Logic Components) for state management.  
  * bloc\_name\_bloc/  
    * bloc\_name\_bloc.dart: The BLoC class itself, handling events and emitting states.  
    * bloc\_name\_event.dart: Defines the events that the BLoC can process.  
    * bloc\_name\_state.dart: Defines the possible states for the feature or part of the feature.  
    * Often includes .freezed.dart files for generated immutable state/event classes.  
* domain/: Contains business logic, entities, and use cases specific to the feature, independent of the UI and data layers if complex enough. For simpler features, this might be less prominent or integrated directly into BLoCs.  
  * Example: workflow\_step.dart, rich\_form\_state.dart, review\_data\_bundle.dart, parameter\_validation\_service.dart in run\_protocol.  
* presentation/: Contains the UI elements.  
  * screens/: Top-level widgets for each route/view within the feature.  
  * widgets/: Reusable UI components specific to this feature.  
    * dialogs/: Specialized dialog widgets.

## **2\. Core Features**

### **2.1. Authentication (**frontend/lib/src/features/auth/**)**

* Purpose: Handles user login and authentication state management.  
* Application (BLoC):  
  * AuthBloc (auth\_bloc.dart):  
    * Events (AuthEvent):  
      * AuthLoginRequested: Triggered when the user attempts to log in.  
      * AuthLogoutRequested: Triggered when the user attempts to log out.  
      * AuthStatusChanged: Internal event, possibly triggered by the AuthService when the authentication state changes (e.g., token expired, user signed in/out via another tab).  
      * AuthUserLoaded: Triggered when user profile data is successfully loaded.  
    * States (AuthState):  
      * AuthInitial: Initial state before any authentication attempt.  
      * AuthLoading: Authentication process is in progress.  
      * AuthAuthenticated: User is successfully authenticated (may hold UserProfile).  
      * AuthUnauthenticated: User is not authenticated or has logged out.  
      * AuthFailure: Authentication attempt failed (may hold an error message).  
    * Logic:  
      * Interacts with AuthRepository (which uses AuthService) to perform login/logout operations.  
      * Listens to an authentication status stream from AuthRepository to react to external auth changes.  
      * Manages the current user's profile.  
      * Its state is used by AppGoRouter to control access to protected routes.  
* Presentation:  
  * screens/login\_screen.dart (LoginScreen):  
    * Provides the UI for the user to initiate the OIDC login flow.  
    * Dispatches AuthLoginRequested to the AuthBloc.  
    * Listens to AuthBloc state changes to show loading indicators or navigate upon success/failure.

### **2.2. Home (**frontend/lib/src/features/home/**)**

* Purpose: Provides the main landing screen after authentication.  
* Presentation:  
  * screens/home\_screen.dart (HomeScreen):  
    * Displays a dashboard or main navigation options.  
    * May show summary information or quick actions.  
    * Likely a simple screen, primarily for navigation to other features.

### **2.3. Protocols (**frontend/lib/src/features/protocols/**)**

* Purpose: Allows users to browse and view details of available protocols. This feature seems to be primarily for listing/viewing, as the main "run protocol" workflow is a separate, more complex feature.  
* Application (BLoC \- Speculative, as no BLoC files are directly in features/protocols/application/):  
  * A ProtocolsBloc or similar might exist (or be part of ProtocolsDiscoveryBloc in run\_protocol) to fetch and display a list of protocols.  
  * Events: LoadProtocolList.  
  * States: ProtocolListLoading, ProtocolListLoaded (List\<ProtocolInfo\>), ProtocolListError.  
* Presentation:  
  * screens/protocols\_screen.dart (ProtocolsScreen):  
    * Displays a list of available protocols fetched from the backend.  
    * Allows navigation to a detailed view of a selected protocol (this detail view might be part of the run\_protocol feature or a separate screen).

### **2.4. Asset Management (**frontend/lib/src/features/assetManagement/**)**

* Purpose: Allows users to view and manage laboratory assets (labware, devices).  
* Application (BLoC \- Speculative):  
  * An AssetManagementBloc would be needed.  
  * Events: LoadAssets, AddAsset, UpdateAsset, DeleteAsset.  
  * States: AssetsLoading, AssetsLoaded (List\<Asset\>), AssetOperationInProgress, AssetOperationSuccess, AssetOperationFailure.  
* Presentation:  
  * screens/assetManagement\_screen.dart (AssetManagementScreen):  
    * Displays lists of different asset types (e.g., labware definitions, device instances).  
    * Provides UI for CRUD operations on assets.  
    * Interacts with an AssetManagementBloc which in turn uses an AssetRepository (not explicitly shown but implied).

### **2.5. Settings (**frontend/lib/src/features/settings/**)**

* Purpose: Allows users to configure application settings.  
* Application (BLoC \- Speculative):  
  * A SettingsBloc might manage theme preferences, notification settings, or other user-configurable options.  
* Presentation:  
  * screens/settings\_screen.dart (SettingsScreen):  
    * Provides UI elements (switches, dropdowns) for modifying settings.  
    * Allows the user to log out (dispatches AuthLogoutRequested to AuthBloc).

### **2.6. Splash (**frontend/lib/src/features/splash/**)**

* Purpose: Shown briefly when the application starts, typically to handle initial setup or determine the initial navigation route (e.g., to Login or Home based on auth state).  
* Presentation:  
  * screens/splash\_screen.dart (SplashScreen):  
    * Displays a logo or loading indicator.  
    * Often listens to the AuthBloc to determine the authentication status.  
    * Navigates to the appropriate screen (LoginScreen or HomeScreen) once initialization is complete or auth state is known.

## **3\. Run Protocol Workflow (**frontend/lib/src/features/run\_protocol/**)**

This is a major, multi-step feature allowing users to select, configure, prepare, and execute a laboratory protocol. It involves several BLoCs and screens.

### **3.1. Domain (**frontend/lib/src/features/run\_protocol/domain/**)**

* workflow\_step.dart (WorkflowStep enum):  
  * Defines the distinct steps in the run protocol workflow (e.g., protocolSelection, parameterConfiguration, deckConfiguration, assetAssignment, reviewAndPrepare, execution).  
* rich\_form\_state.dart (RichFormState):  
  * A freezed class likely used to manage the state of complex forms, particularly for parameter configuration. It might hold values, validation status, and error messages for form fields.  
* review\_data\_bundle.dart (ReviewDataBundle):  
  * A freezed class used to aggregate all the data collected throughout the configuration steps (selected protocol, parameters, deck layout, asset assignments) for display on the review screen.  
* parameter\_validation\_service.dart (ParameterValidationService):  
  * Provides utility functions to validate protocol parameter values based on their types and constraints (defined in ParameterConfig from the backend).

### **3.2. Application (BLoCs)**

This feature uses multiple BLoCs, each managing a part of the workflow or a specific data aspect.

* ProtocolsDiscoveryBloc (protocols\_discovery\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Fetches the list of available protocols from the backend.  
  * Events: FetchProtocols.  
  * States: ProtocolsDiscoveryInitial, ProtocolsDiscoveryLoading, ProtocolsDiscoveryLoaded (List\<ProtocolInfo\>), ProtocolsDiscoveryError.  
  * Used by ProtocolSelectionScreen.  
* ProtocolParametersBloc (protocol\_parameters\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Manages the fetching of detailed protocol information (including parameters) and the state of parameter configuration.  
  * Events: LoadProtocolDetails (String protocolId), UpdateParameterValue (String paramName, dynamic value), ValidateParameters.  
  * States: ProtocolParametersInitial, ProtocolParametersLoading, ProtocolParametersLoaded (ProtocolDetails details, Map\<String, dynamic\> currentValues, Map\<String, String\> validationErrors), ProtocolParametersError.  
  * Uses ParameterValidationService.  
  * Used by ParameterConfigurationScreen.  
* DeckConfigurationBloc (deck\_configuration\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Manages the state of deck layout selection and labware assignment to deck slots.  
  * Events: LoadDeckLayouts, SelectDeckLayout (String layoutId), AssignLabwareToSlot (String slotId, String labwareId).  
  * States: DeckConfigurationInitial, DeckConfigurationLoading, DeckConfigurationLoaded (List\<DeckLayout\> layouts, DeckLayout? selectedLayout, Map\<String, String\> slotAssignments), DeckConfigurationError.  
  * Used by DeckConfigurationScreen.  
* ProtocolAssetsBloc (protocol\_assets\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Manages the assignment of specific physical assets (e.g., particular plates, tip boxes from inventory) to the roles defined in the protocol.  
  * Events: LoadRequiredAssets (ProtocolDetails details), AssignPhysicalAsset (String requiredAssetName, String physicalAssetId).  
  * States: ProtocolAssetsInitial, ProtocolAssetsLoading, ProtocolAssetsLoaded (List\<ProtocolAsset\> requiredAssets, Map\<String, String\> assignments), ProtocolAssetsError.  
  * Used by AssetAssignmentScreen.  
* ProtocolReviewBloc (protocol\_review\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Aggregates all configured data for user review before preparing the protocol run on the backend.  
  * Events: LoadReviewData (ReviewDataBundle bundle).  
  * States: ProtocolReviewInitial, ProtocolReviewLoaded (ReviewDataBundle bundle).  
  * Used by ReviewAndPrepareScreen.  
* ProtocolStartBloc (protocol\_start\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Handles the final "prepare" and "start" API calls to the backend for a configured protocol.  
  * Events: PrepareProtocolRun (ProtocolPrepareRequest request), StartProtocolExecution (String runId).  
  * States: ProtocolStartInitial, ProtocolPreparationInProgress, ProtocolPreparationSuccess (String runId), ProtocolPreparationFailure, ProtocolExecutionInProgress, ProtocolExecutionSuccess, ProtocolExecutionFailure.  
  * Used by ReviewAndPrepareScreen (for prepare) and StartProtocolScreen (for start/monitoring).  
* ProtocolWorkflowBloc (protocol\_workflow\_bloc/):  
  * Purpose: Manages the overall navigation and state of the multi-step run protocol workflow.  
  * Events: AdvanceToStep (WorkflowStep step, dynamic data), GoToPreviousStep.  
  * States: ProtocolWorkflowState (WorkflowStep currentStep, ProtocolInfo? selectedProtocol, ProtocolDetails? protocolDetails, Map\<String, dynamic\>? configuredParameters, ... etc.). This state holds the aggregated data as the user progresses.  
  * This BLoC orchestrates the flow between the different screens of the run\_protocol feature.

### **3.3. Presentation (**frontend/lib/src/features/run\_protocol/presentation/**)**

* screens/run\_protocol\_workflow\_screen.dart (RunProtocolWorkflowScreen):  
  * Likely the main entry point or container screen for the entire run protocol feature.  
  * Manages the display of the current workflow step based on the ProtocolWorkflowBloc state.  
  * Might use a PageViewer or nested Navigator to switch between different configuration screens.  
* screens/protocol\_selection\_screen.dart (ProtocolSelectionScreen):  
  * Displays a list of protocols (from ProtocolsDiscoveryBloc).  
  * Allows the user to select a protocol to run.  
  * On selection, updates ProtocolWorkflowBloc and navigates to the next step.  
* screens/parameter\_configuration\_screen.dart (ParameterConfigurationScreen):  
  * Displays forms for configuring the parameters of the selected protocol (using ProtocolParametersBloc and ProtocolDetails).  
  * Uses widgets from dialogs/ (e.g., StringParameterEditScreen, DictionaryParameterEditScreen, ArrayParameterEditDialog, BasicParameterEditDialog) for editing different parameter types.  
  * Implements validation logic.  
* screens/deck\_configuration\_screen.dart (DeckConfigurationScreen):  
  * Allows users to select a deck layout and assign labware to slots (using DeckConfigurationBloc).  
  * May visually represent the deck.  
* screens/asset\_assignment\_screen.dart (AssetAssignmentScreen):  
  * Allows users to map required protocol assets to specific physical assets from inventory (using ProtocolAssetsBloc).

  * Displays a summary of all configurations (protocol, parameters, deck, assets) using ReviewDataBundle (from ProtocolReviewBloc).  
  * Allows the user to initiate the "prepare" call to the backend (via ProtocolStartBloc).  
* screens/start\_protocol\_screen.dart (StartProtocolScreen):  
  * Shown after a protocol run is successfully prepared.  
  * Allows the user to trigger the "start" of the protocol execution.  
  * Displays the status and progress of the running protocol (polling ProtocolStartBloc or a dedicated status BLoC).  
  * May offer controls like pause, resume, cancel (if implemented).  
* widgets/dialogs/:  
  * basic\_parameter\_edit\_dialog.dart: For simple parameter types (int, float, bool).  
  * string\_parameter\_edit\_screen.dart: For string parameters, possibly with multi-line support.  
  * array\_parameter\_edit\_dialog.dart: For editing lists of values.  
  * dictionary\_parameter\_edit\_screen.dart: For editing key-value map parameters.

## **4\. TODOs & Priorities (Chunk 4 Scope)**

* High Priority:  
  * Complete run\_protocol Workflow Implementation: Ensure all BLoCs, screens, and their interactions within the run\_protocol feature are fully implemented and tested, including data flow, validation, and API calls.  
  * Robust Parameter Editing UI: Make sure the parameter editing dialogs (frontend/lib/src/features/run\_protocol/presentation/widgets/dialogs/) are user-friendly and handle all parameter types and constraints correctly.  
  * State Persistence in Workflow: Implement state persistence for the ProtocolWorkflowBloc so users don't lose their progress if they navigate away or the app restarts mid-configuration (e.g., using hydrated\_bloc or manual saving to local storage).  
  * Real-time Protocol Execution Monitoring: Enhance StartProtocolScreen to provide robust real-time (or near real-time via polling) feedback on protocol execution status, logs, and any errors from the backend.  
* Medium Priority:  
  * Implement Missing Feature BLoCs: Develop BLoCs for features like protocols (if not covered by ProtocolsDiscoveryBloc), assetManagement, and settings if they require complex state management.  
  * UI/UX Refinement: Review and refine the UI/UX of all feature screens for clarity, consistency, and ease of use.  
  * Comprehensive Error Handling in UI: Ensure all feature screens gracefully handle and display errors reported by their BLoCs.  
* Low Priority (for initial alpha, but important long-term):  
  * Implement advanced UI for deck visualization and configuration.  
  * Add more detailed views for asset management (e.g., asset history, calibration data).  
  * Develop UI for any manual workcell control features exposed by the backend.  
  * Integrate Vixn Suite (Future Direction): Plan for future integration of a "Vixn suite" or similar functionality to allow users to view and analyze data from protocol runs directly within the application. For now, this primarily involves keeping this potential future requirement in mind during architectural decisions related to data logging and retrieval.

This chunk provides a detailed look into the feature modules of the Flutter frontend. The run\_protocol feature is clearly the most complex and central part of the UI. The next and final chunk will cover build systems, configuration, testing, and other ancillary files.

# **PylabPraxis Codebase Documentation \- Chunk 5: Build, Configuration, Testing & Ancillary Files**

Last Updated: June 10, 2024

This document covers the build systems, deployment configurations, testing setups, and other ancillary files that support the PylabPraxis project. It encompasses both the Python backend (in backend/) and the Flutter frontend (in frontend/).

## **1\. Containerization & Orchestration (**docker-compose.yml**)**

* Purpose: The docker-compose.yml file defines and manages the multi-container Docker application, orchestrating the various services PylabPraxis relies on.  
* Key Services Defined:  
  * backend: The Python FastAPI backend application.  
    * Builds from the local Dockerfile (likely at the root of the project or in the backend/ directory).  
    * Exposes a port (e.g., 8000\) for the API.  
    * Depends on db (PostgreSQL) and redis.  
    * Mounts local code for development (hot-reloading).  
    * Environment variables for database connection, Redis, Keycloak settings, etc., are likely passed here or sourced from an .env file.  
  * db: PostgreSQL database.  
    * Uses an official PostgreSQL image.  
    * Configures volume for data persistence (pgdata).  
    * Sets environment variables for user, password, and database name.  
  * redis: Redis in-memory data store.  
    * Uses an official Redis image.  
    * Used for caching, distributed locks (backend.utils.redis\_lock), and runtime state management for PraxisState.  
  * keycloak: Keycloak Identity and Access Management server.  
    * Uses an official Keycloak image (e.g., jboss/keycloak or quay.io/keycloak/keycloak).  
    * Configures admin credentials.  
    * Mounts the keycloak/praxis-realm.json file to import the PylabPraxis realm configuration on startup.  
    * Exposes ports (e.g., 8080, 8443).  
  * frontend: (Potentially, if serving the built web app via a static server like Nginx, or for development purposes).  
    * If for web, might build from a Dockerfile in frontend/ that serves the output of flutter build web.  
* TODOs & Considerations:  
  * Ensure production-ready configurations for Docker (e.g., resource limits, non-root users, security hardening).  
  * Review volume mounts for data persistence and development convenience.

## **2\. Authentication Configuration (Keycloak)**

* keycloak/praxis-realm.json:  
  * Purpose: Defines the Keycloak realm "praxis" (or similar). This JSON file can be imported into Keycloak to set up clients, roles, users, and authentication flows.  
  * Contents:  
    * Realm details (name, display name, enabled status).  
    * Client definitions (e.g., for the Python backend, Flutter frontend \- web, mobile).  
      * Client ID, client secret (for confidential clients like the backend).  
      * Valid redirect URIs (e.g., for frontend OIDC callback frontend/web/auth-callback.html).  
      * Access type (public for frontend, confidential for backend).  
      * Standard flow, direct access grants, service accounts enabled as needed.  
      * Mappers for user attributes/roles to tokens.  
    * Realm roles (e.g., admin, user, protocol\_designer).  
    * User definitions (optional, for initial setup).  
    * Authentication flows.  
* keycloak.json (Root level):  
  * Purpose: This file is typically a Keycloak OIDC client adapter configuration file, often used by backend applications or Keycloak-aware proxies to understand how to interact with the Keycloak server for a specific client.  
  * Contents: Realm name, auth server URL, client ID, credentials (if applicable).  
  * Its usage in this project needs to be confirmed (e.g., is it used by the FastAPI backend directly, or is configuration primarily through environment variables loaded into backend.configure.Settings?).

## **6\. TODOs & Priorities (Chunk 5 Scope)**

* High Priority:  
  * Finalize Docker Configuration: Ensure docker-compose.yml is production-ready and development environment is smooth.  
  * Secure Keycloak Setup: Review praxis-realm.json for security best practices. Ensure client secrets are handled appropriately (e.g., via environment variables in Docker Compose, not hardcoded).  
  * Establish CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing (backend and frontend) and potentially builds/deployments.  
  * Comprehensive Testing:  
    * Backend: Expand unit and integration tests significantly.  
    * Frontend: Implement widget, BLoC, and integration tests.  
* Medium Priority:  
  * Standardize Configuration Management: Clarify the role of praxis.ini vs. environment variables vs. keycloak.json. Consider renaming praxis.ini if it only pertains to the backend.  
  * Review and Update Documentation: Ensure README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are up-to-date with current setup and contribution processes.  
  * Refine Static Analysis Rules: Ensure mypy.ini and frontend/analysis\_options.yaml enforce desired code quality standards.  
* Low Priority:  
  * Optimize platform-specific build configurations if needed for performance or size.  
  * Implement more sophisticated log management for the backend (e.g., log rotation, structured logging).

This concludes the five-part documentation of the PylabPraxis codebase. It provides a comprehensive overview for an LLM to understand the project's structure, key components, development status, and future directions.
