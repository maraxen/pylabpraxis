"""260901 T14 (backlog #4862): permanent end-to-end verification of
``check_graph`` against the NON-LEGACY contract table specifically
(``plr-jit/data/derived_contracts.upstream_nonlegacy.json``, produced by
T13's ``upstream_nonlegacy`` surface).

**Why this file exists, not just more cases in ``test_check_graph.py``.**
Every existing end-to-end test in that file loads
``data/derived_contracts.json`` -- the ``legacy_pinned`` surface's table.
Earlier spot-checks during T13/T14 recon (``VSpinBackend.spin``,
``BioShake.start_shaking``) were run against that OLD pin's table, not this
surface's own -- passing there proves nothing about whether ``check_graph``
actually resolves real operations through THIS contract table. This file is
the missing direct confirmation, kept permanent (not a one-off script) so a
future regeneration of ``derived_contracts.upstream_nonlegacy.json`` that
silently breaks the lookup shape gets caught by CI, not by a human
re-running an ad hoc snippet.

**Surface facts asserted, not assumed** (T13's own measurements, restated
here as the load-bearing assumptions this file's fixtures depend on):
``upstream_nonlegacy`` has NO ``class_name == "LiquidHandler"`` record at
all (``machines/`` is a bare ``__init__.py``; ``LiquidHandler`` exists only
under ``legacy/``), so its contract table has zero ``LiquidHandler.*`` keys
-- ``test_liquid_handler_is_genuinely_absent_from_this_surface`` pins that
fact directly, since every other test in this module silently depends on it
(a real ``LiquidHandler.<name>`` operation resolving here, post-regen, would
mean the surfaces were accidentally re-merged, not that this file's cases
were wrong).

**Family selection.** One real, finding-bearing, guard-populated
``(receiver_type, method_name)`` pair from each of the eight families named
in the T14 brief (``revvity``, ``agilent``, ``hamilton``, ``brooks``,
``molecular_devices``, ``high_res``, ``io``, ``resources``), chosen by
inspecting ``derived_contracts.upstream_nonlegacy.json`` directly (not
guessed) so each op is guaranteed to exercise a real, populated contract
entry -- the same "must not be satisfiable via ``receiver_type_unknown``
alone" discipline ``test_check_graph.py``'s D1 flag already established for
the legacy fixture (see ``test_fixture_exercises_contract_table_lookup``
there).

**Site-path assertion, not existence.** T13's ``upstream_nonlegacy``
extraction used ``git archive <sha> | tar -x`` into an ephemeral
``--plr-root`` (a temp directory) rather than a stable, committed tree like
``external/pylabrobot`` -- the guard ``site.file`` paths recorded in the
committed ``derived_contracts.upstream_nonlegacy.json`` therefore point at a
path that no longer exists on disk (confirmed 260901: the T13 extraction
directory is gone). Asserting ``Path(f.plr_site.file).exists()`` would
therefore be a FALSE negative on every future checkout, not a real check.
What IS load-bearing and stable is the path's SUFFIX -- the PLR-relative
module path (e.g. ``pylabrobot/revvity/celigo/camera.py``) -- which is a
property of PLR's own source layout at the pinned commit, not of where the
extraction happened to land. Every site assertion below checks that suffix.
