"""plr_jit._provenance.stamp: process-memoized SurveyStamp (spec 260901 §2.2;
``Surface`` parameterization added 260901 T13, backlog #4859).

Supersedes plr_survey_common.plr_version_stamp()'s {git_sha, git_dirty: bool}
pair with a full GitState for both the PLR submodule and the analyzer's own
repo, plus the installed pylabrobot package version if importable.

**T13 -- the analyzed surface is a parameter, not a constant.** Before T13
this module hardcoded ``_PLR_SUBMODULE = external/pylabrobot`` as the ONLY
tree ``survey_stamp()`` could ever describe -- silently coupling every
stamp to whichever PLR checkout happened to be pinned. ``Surface`` makes
"which tree" an explicit, named value: ``(name, tree_path, pin)``. Two
surfaces exist today (see the report for this task): ``DEFAULT_SURFACE``
(``"legacy_pinned"``, our checked-out submodule) and an upstream snapshot
extracted out-of-repo via ``git archive <sha> | tar -x`` (no ``.git``
directory, so ``capture_git_state`` on it degrades to the ``"nogit"``
sentinel -- exactly its documented, never-raising behavior; that's why
``Surface.pin`` exists as an explicit, caller-supplied fact rather than
something this module tries to infer from a tree that structurally cannot
answer "what commit is this" via git).

Normative -- memoization: survey_stamp() is memoized **at most once per
process PER SURFACE** (a module-level dict cache keyed on
``(surface.name, str(surface.tree_path))``, populated on first call for
that key); repeated calls for the SAME surface within the same process
return the cached SurveyStamp rather than re-invoking capture_git_state, but
a call for a DIFFERENT surface computes and caches its own independent
entry. A dirty tree's tree-OID computation costs ~8 subprocesses
(git_state._compute_dirty_content_id), so a SurveyStamp is ~16 subprocesses
total (plr + praxis) if recomputed per call -- the memoization is what keeps
"every emitted event carries the full SurveyStamp" (spec §4.1) affordable.
emit() never shells out; it only serializes whatever SurveyStamp object it
is handed.
