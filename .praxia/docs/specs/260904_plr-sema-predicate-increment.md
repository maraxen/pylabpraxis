title: "plr-sema increment 6 — the predicate language: a three-valued grammar over guard conditions, measured by the UNKNOWN ledger"
description: "Sixth post-corpus increment to the plr-sema pre-corpus specification, taking the main spec's deferred row (c), revised after adversarial round 1 (C1-C18 + D1-D3). What it ships, narrowed as round 1 forced: **per-finding SAFE on real executed operations plus a legible residual** -- NO joined SAFE this increment. Round-1 changes carried here: E-UNCOND gains clauses (4) no WILL_FAIL at depth >= 1, (5) a depth-0 empty scope_trail is not vacuously unconditional, (6) the raise_guard's own condition entry at scope_trail[0] is excluded from both scope tests; the tier-1 soundness fence is left UNMODIFIED (the exc_class -> site narrowing is deleted) and rows_excused_by_scope becomes a pure annotation; tier (iii) is DERIVED as guard.is_dynamic_raise and emits one Finding, UNKNOWN/guard_env_dependent, plus an excludes_sites annotation; the GO gate is restated over REASONS (zero guard_predicate_unparsed and zero guard_operand_unknown on >= 1 executed op) rather than over tiers, which would have been self-satisfying; E-TYPE is restated T iff is-or-subclass-of / F iff hierarchy-disjoint AND exact, with _generic_plr_type_name declarations normatively never exact; E-CALL gains param_defaults (D1), the beta truthiness interaction, the parameter-rebinding clause and the depth->=1 forbiddance; beta gains the length-preserving-rebinding exception (population 8, measured) and the iterand single-write clause; AC-15.8's >= 1,000 floor is replaced by n_findings_decided >= 223. Four decisions were left at round 1 as pending user approval with this round's recommendation (all four APPROVED 260907; see the amendment note below): HM-25 declared 8 -> 9 for alpha+beta (recommend yes), the headline substitution to increment 7 (recommend yes), gamma (recommend no, increment 7), and REASON_VOCABULARY 10 -> 12 of cap 12 (recommend yes, one-member fallback described). Ledger re-run under positional (row_idx, op_id) keying: 544 executed ops, unresolved_delegate cluster 93, :375/:383 at 544, consistency ok, n_row_id_collisions 12 all move_*. AMENDED 260907 (spec_version 18) after band B measured the gate NO-GO. All five sprint decisions are APPROVED by the user: HM-25 declared 8 -> 9 (AC-15.7 asserts 9), the headline substitution, gamma NOT adopted, REASON_VOCABULARY 10 -> 12, and this amendment itself. The amendment adds three productions to section 15.2: EnvRef(path, args) for an expression rooted at the literal name self (an attribute chain, optionally the callee of a call whose arguments all parse as Terms); Zip(items) as a Term usable as the seq of AllOf/AnyOf; and the membership comparators in/not in as Cmp ops. All three evaluate to half/top unconditionally (section 15.4 E-ENV) and carry guard_env_dependent rather than guard_predicate_unparsed when no Opaque node remains (section 15.7), which reconciles the section 15.7 / section 15.9 disagreement over line 409 that the measurement exposed. Re-predicted: pick_up_tips' two blockers (liquid_handler.py:409 and :514) both flip, giving {decidable, guard_env_dependent} = GO; every other candidate method's blocker is NOT self-rooted and does not flip (:657 rooted at a local, :116 an is-comparison with a non-None RHS, :2030 tuple displays, :2211 a BinOp, :2226 an is-comparison). Section 15.9 gains a published n_env_ref per cluster and per op, a top-10 EnvRef path list, a normative no-Var(self) invariant, and a T35 task row (grammar amendment, contract regeneration, the t30_measure population and family-dispatch fix-ups, re-measure) before T31. REVISED 260907 (spec_version 19) after the amendment's short adversarial pass (A-C1..A-C13, verdict needs_revision, revise-and-advance; no objection changed the GO prediction). What round 2 changed: G7 shape (2) now admits a self-rooted CALL only when the callee path has length >= 3 or its length-2 name is ABSENT from the derive package's own PLR function index -- a derived test, no list -- so PLR-layer helper calls (self._is_error_tail, self._check_96_head_fits_in_container, self._find_available_sites_sorted) stay Opaque as the coverage gaps they are, the stamp row's :1778/:1940 no longer flip, and n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer is published; the withdrawn narrowness claim is replaced by the measured 210/41 absorption counts. 'The amendment decides nothing' is now a THEOREM rather than a prediction: a Zip resolves to top unless every item resolves to a concrete Seq (then the positional zip truncated to the shortest), AllOf/AnyOf over a top seq is half and never vacuously T, and the membership deciding case is DELETED -- every in/not in Cmp is half unconditionally this increment, recorded as a refused production in section 15.13. Both contains_opaque and contains_env_ref range over the alpha/beta-SUBSTITUTED predicate, which the shipped classifier already assumes. Section 15.7's clauses are reordered so the operand test precedes contains_env_ref. The registry point is conceded: EnvRef/Zip/in are named inside the alpha+beta HM-25 entry and _measure_hm25 must import the production symbols. n_env_ref is split into n_env_ref_nodes (block 3) and n_env_ref_guards (block 4); the re-prediction table restates every cell as an exact guards/nodes pair. T30c is renamed T35 so the cross-reference lint can see it, and the amendment's ACs are gated on T35 directly. Its output is outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260908.json or later; the population fix-up already landed as t30_measured_260907.json (commit 15b84d31)."

## 15.0 The instrument and the claim

Sprint 123 closed with every oracle tier at 0 unsound and `unknown_rate` 1.0 on all ten methods. Band
B0 built the instrument that says *why*, and it is a stronger instrument than the planning-time probe:
it reuses `run_static_calls` unmodified and reads findings through the `FINDINGS_SINK` seam installed
after relabelling (`plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:593-611`), so the numbers are the pipeline's own.

**The numbers, verbatim, from the ledger as re-run after band B0's `row_id` fix.** 544 executed
operations, 544 with `n_ops_unknown` equal to `n_ops_executed` (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:29-37`); 6,036 findings,
of which `guard_predicate_unparsed` 5,656 / `volume_state_unknown` 194 / `unresolved_delegate` 186;
**54 clusters** keyed on `(reason, PLR site, condition text)`.

> **Round-1 correction (C12 / item 17, landed as `ca756bce` before this revision).** Every per-op set
> in the ledger is now keyed by the **positional** `(row_idx, op_id)` pair, never by `(row_id, op_id)`
> (`plr-sema/eval/unknown_ledger.py:133-155`, whose docstring states the rule and its reason).
> `row_id` is a content digest that collides across a documented ~4% of corpus rows, so the pre-fix
> ledger silently merged two different ops from two different rows into one `ops_blocked` entry.
> **Three published numbers moved as a result**: the `unresolved_delegate` cluster's `n_ops_blocked`
> 81 → **93**, `liquid_handler.py:375`'s and `:383`'s 532 → **544**, and `:2092`'s 81 → **93**. The
> ledger now publishes a `consistency` block reporting `"ok": true` with an empty `violations` list
> and three independent invariants checked
> (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:3243-3263`;
> `plr-sema/eval/unknown_ledger.py:332-407` defines them), plus `n_row_id_collisions` **12** and a
> `collision_ops` section naming every one of the twelve
> (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:2184-2273`). All twelve are `move_*`
> (`move_plate` 7, `move_lid` 3, `move_resource` 2), each carrying the reason set exactly
> `{guard_predicate_unparsed, unresolved_delegate}` and 13 distinct guard sites — `_check_args`'s
> `:375` and `:383` among them
> (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:2216-2230`). **So the challenger's "12
> unaccounted operations" do not exist**: they were duplicate `move_*` occurrences the pre-fix set
> keying folded away, and they are inside the 93 the histogram always reported. §15.14 Q1's stated
> refutation criterion is answered below.

**Three reason-set combinations, not two** (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:2162-2183`):

| per-op reason set | ops | note |
|---|---|---|
| `{guard_predicate_unparsed}` | 334 | `pick_up_tips`, `drop_tips`, `discard_tips`, `stamp`, and the tip half of the mixed rows |
| `{guard_predicate_unparsed, volume_state_unknown}` | 117 | `aspirate` 77 + `dispense` 40 — the unseeded volume cell |
| `{guard_predicate_unparsed, unresolved_delegate}` | 93 | `move_lid` 31 / `move_plate` 31 / `move_resource` 31 — **deferred row (e)**, `_state_updated` |

**The third combination is out of this increment and can never be a gate candidate.** Its
`unresolved_delegate` cluster is not a guard at all: its `plr_site` is `<none>` and its `condition` is
the bare delegate name `_state_updated`, with `n_findings` 186 over `n_ops_blocked` **93** and a
`per_method` breakdown that now sums to 93
(`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:1123-1134`), i.e. the transitive `delegates_to`
closure hit an `unresolved_calls` entry (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:602-603`). That is
deferred row (e) (`.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:2520`), which no predicate
grammar touches. Every `move_*` operation therefore keeps a residual this increment cannot move, and
`move_resource`/`move_lid`/`move_plate` are excluded from §15.9's candidate list by construction.

**`n_ops_sole_blocker` is 0 for all 54 clusters.** Every cluster in the ledger reports
`"n_ops_sole_blocker": 0` — the largest, `liquid_handler.py:375`'s `len(missing) > 0`, blocks **all
544** ops and is the sole blocker of none
(`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:39-57`). **The consequence is normative for how
this increment is measured**: removing any cluster, or any set of clusters short of *all* of an
operation's, moves `unknown_rate` by exactly zero. A metric of the form "clusters removed" or
"findings converted" would show a large number while the analyzer still says nothing about any
program. §15.9's gate is therefore **per-op residual tier composition** (sprint plan
`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:97-110`), and that is the only number in
this document allowed to decide GO.

**Three places the ledger corrects the sprint plan, recorded because a stale premise is how the next
person mis-sizes the work.**

1. **`liquid_handler.py:191`'s `self.setup_finished` guard does not reach real operations.** The plan's
   §0 table carries a `:191 d1 setup` row at count 38 and asks band B0 to explain it
   (`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:63`). The ledger's own `notes` show it
   *cannot* appear: `run_static_calls` computes `setup_pcs` from the bytecode's `origin` sideband and
   filters every setup-pc finding out of `raw_findings` **before** relabelling
   (`plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:600-607`), so no setup-pc finding can be relabelled onto a real
   `op_<i>` and the seam never sees one
   (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:1914-1915`). The plan's row was an artifact of
   an ephemeral probe that wrapped `check_ir` directly. **No cluster at `liquid_handler.py:191` exists
   in the ledger, and `LiquidHandler.setup`'s own guard is not in scope for this increment.**
2. **544 executed ops, not 548 — and 544 is now both the occurrence count and the distinct count.**
   `oracle_replay.py`'s own `operations_executed` is 548; the ledger counts 544 **positional**
   `(row_idx, op_id)` pairs carrying ≥ 1 real finding. The four-op gap is ops that received a synthetic
   zero-finding placeholder rather than a `check_ir` result, which carry no reason to cluster
   (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:3266`). *The draft called 544 "distinct
   `(row_id, op_id)` pairs"; under the old keying that phrase named a smaller population than the
   counter actually held, which is precisely C12's complaint.* Under positional keying the two
   coincide: `n_ops_executed` increments once per `(row_idx, op_id)` and the key is unique by
   construction, asserted in the clustering loop itself
   (`plr-sema/eval/unknown_ledger.py:226-235`). The ledger's own note 2 text retains the legacy
   "distinct `(row_id, op_id)` pairs" wording (`plr-sema/eval/unknown_ledger.py:507-516`); the value it
   reports is correct and this document, not the note string, is the place the distinction is stated.
   Every ratio in this document uses 544.
3. **Two reason-set combinations were planned; there are three.** The plan's §0 probe found
   `{guard_predicate_unparsed}` and `{guard_predicate_unparsed, volume_state_unknown}`
   (`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:42-43`); the full-benchmark ledger adds
   the `unresolved_delegate` combination, which is 93 ops — 17% of the benchmark — permanently outside
   this increment.

**The coupling claim is now confirmed per operation, not merely per method.** §15.5's argument used to
rest on a per-method reading of the clusters, which C12 correctly objected could not see an individual
operation. Under the corrected keying it can: `liquid_handler.py:375` and `:383` each report
`n_findings` 544 over `n_ops_blocked` 544 with a `per_method` breakdown summing to 544
(`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:39-57`, `:86-104`), and the ledger's own
`consistency` invariant 3 asserts `sum(per_method) == n_ops_blocked` for **every** cluster
(`plr-sema/eval/unknown_ledger.py:353-356`, result at
`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:3244-3245`). So **every one of the 544 executed
operations carries both `_check_args` guards**, both of which are tier (ii). §15.14 Q1's refutation
criterion — *"name one executed operation whose non-(iii) residual is empty"* — is therefore answered
in the negative by measurement rather than by argument: there is no such operation.

**The claim, stated as narrowly as increment 5 stated its own — and the user approved this narrowing
on 260907** (§15.5's decision box, §15.14 Q7;
`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:262-265`). A joined `SAFE` on a real operation
would claim that operation cannot fail. This increment **does not produce one** (§15.5), and the
narrow claim it does support is: *for a guard whose condition parses to a non-`Opaque` predicate and
whose every operand resolves from the IR call, the analyzer states whether that guard fires, and when
it says `SAFE` the claim is "this PLR precondition does not hold against this call", nothing more.*
Everything wider — that the operation succeeds, that the backend accepts it, that the deck contains
the resource — is out of scope and is named as such, per finding, by §15.7's reasons.

## 15.1 The three decidability tiers

> **Normative (the tiers).** Every guard reachable from an executed operation is assigned exactly one
> tier, and the assignment is a property of *what would decide the guard*, not of whether this
> increment decides it.
>
> **(i) syntactic.** Decided from the call's literal kwargs, the resolved contract's parameter
> defaults, and `RESOURCE` operands as declared in the IR (`type`, `element_type`, `grid` —
> `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/ir.py:178-192`). No hypothesis, no observation.
>
> **(ii) environment / observation.** Requires state outside the extracted graph: a process-global
> (`get_strictness()`, the `does_volume_tracking()` shape increment 5 already models as an `env`
> member, §14.6), the backend class and its method signatures, the deck (membership, lid topology, head
> channel count), or a container's seeded contents. Decidable only under a recorded hypothesis or an
> observation returned from the executed window.
>
> **(iii) opaque.** The backend's own raise, re-raised. `error is not None` at
> `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:575-576` and its three siblings.
> Never decided from the PLR layer, under any observation this analyzer can take.

> **Normative (tier (iii) is DERIVED, at zero registry cost — round 1, C8).** A guard is tier (iii)
> **iff** `guard.is_dynamic_raise` — the shipped property that tests `raises.startswith("<dynamic:")`
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:505-509` — re-anchored in round 2, A-C11; the property
> moved when `bindings` was added), which the survey sets for a
> `raise <ast.Name>`, i.e. a re-raise of a locally-bound exception name
> (`scripts/survey_plr_preconditions.py:231-240`). **No site list, no `condition` text match, no new
> pattern, no registry row.** At this pin the rule selects exactly seven sites in
> `liquid_handler.py` — `:576`, `:726`, `:1067`, `:1271`, `:1510`, `:1590`, `:2092` — which is the
> population §15.1's tables name plus `:2092`, the one a syntactic `condition == "error is not None"`
> rule would have missed (`:2092`'s condition is `<unconditional>`,
> `outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:763-774`).
>
> **Tiers (i) and (ii) are NOT derived and are not the gate.** The draft's implicit assumption — that
> the evaluator could recognise a tier at measurement time — is withdrawn. A derived (i)/(ii) split of
> the form *"decides ⇒ (i), else (ii)"* would make §15.9's GO condition true by construction, which is
> the opposite of what §15.9 says it is for. **§15.1's (i)/(ii) tiering below is therefore this
> document's PREDICTION only**; the gate is restated over reasons in §15.9, and T30's measured block
> (3) publishes the reason each cluster actually carries so prediction and measurement can diverge
> visibly.

**The tiering of every cluster in the ledger.** Conditions are quoted verbatim from the ledger; local
bindings are quoted from PLR at pin `dd79c4c89`. "grammar" = decidable by §15.2 alone; "α"/"β" = needs
that §15.3 idiom; "O1" = needs §15.4's operand observation. **Every (i)/(ii) cell is a prediction to be
falsified by T30, per the box above.**

### 15.1.1 The `pick_up_tips` closure — the gate candidate

| PLR site | condition (verbatim) | local binding | tier | needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `liquid_handler.py:498` | `len(not_tip_spots) > 0` | `not_tip_spots = [ts for ts in tip_spots if not isinstance(ts, TipSpot)]` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:496`) | (i) | α + O1 |
| `liquid_handler.py:502` | `len(set(use_channels)) == len(use_channels)` | `use_channels = use_channels or self._default_use_channels or list(range(len(tip_spots)))` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:501`) | (i) | grammar + P3a |
| `liquid_handler.py:522` | `len(tip_spots) == len(offsets) == len(use_channels)` | `offsets = offsets or [Coordinate.zero()] * len(tip_spots)` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:517`) | (i) | β + P3a |
| `liquid_handler.py:514` | `not all((self.backend.can_pick_up_tip(channel, tip) for channel, tip in zip(use_channels, tips)))` | — | (ii) backend | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:375` | `len(missing) > 0` | `missing = non_default - backend_kws` over `inspect.signature(method)` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:353-373`) | (ii) backend signature | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:383` | `strictness == Strictness.STRICT` | under `if len(extra) > 0 and len(vars_keyword) == 0:` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:381`) | (ii) env **and** backend | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:409` | `not len(invalid_channels) == 0` | `invalid_channels = [c for c in channels if c not in self.head]` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:407`) | (ii) head channel count | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:321` | `not resource_from_deck == resource` | `resource_from_deck = self.deck.get_resource(resource.name)` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:318`) | (ii) deck membership | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:576` | `error is not None` | `error` rebound in an `except` handler (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:551-555`) | **(iii)** | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:535` | *(tip typestate; decided since increment 1, `SAFE`/`WILL_FAIL`/`channel_state_unknown`)* | — | decided | — |

`pick_up_tips` carries ten guards and zero gaps at this pin; nine appear in the ledger (223 findings
each, e.g. `:498`'s cluster at `outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:217-227`) and the
tenth is already evaluated. **Its predicted residual after §15.2–§15.4 is `{guard_env_dependent}`
alone** — no `guard_predicate_unparsed`, no `guard_operand_unknown` — which is §15.9's restated GO
condition.

> **Measured, then amended (260907).** T30 falsified that prediction: `:409` and `:514` carried
> `guard_predicate_unparsed`, because their conditions read the receiver's head and backend through
> shapes the grammar had no production for — `c not in self.head` and a `zip(...)` over
> `self.backend.can_pick_up_tip(channel, tip)`. **Note that this table already tiered both (ii)**, so
> the failure was never in the tiering; it was that a tier-(ii) *read* and a grammar *gap* were
> indistinguishable in the reason vocabulary's output. §15.2 G7/G8 make them distinguishable and
> §15.9's re-prediction table restores this row's `{guard_env_dependent}` — as a prediction for **T35**
> to falsify in turn, not as a restatement of the one that already failed. Note that all three of the guards the gate rests on (`:498`, `:502`, `:522`) sit at
`depth == 0` in `pick_up_tips`'s own body
(`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:488-524`), so E-UNCOND(4)'s new
`depth >= 1` forbiddance does not reach them; the five depth-1 guards (`:375`, `:383`, `:409`, `:321`
and, at depth 0 but backend-dependent, `:514`) were already predicted `guard_env_dependent`.

### 15.1.2 The `drop_tips` / `discard_tips` closure — *not* a candidate, and why

| PLR site | condition | local binding | tier | needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `liquid_handler.py:647` | `len(not_tip_spots) > 0` | `not_tip_spots = [ts for ts in tip_spots if not isinstance(ts, (TipSpot, Trash))]` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:645`) | (i) | α (tuple form) + O1 |
| `liquid_handler.py:651` | `len(set(use_channels)) == len(use_channels)` | as `:501` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:650`) | (i) | grammar + P3a |
| `liquid_handler.py:657` | `tip.tracker.get_used_volume() > 0 and (not allow_nonzero_volume)` | `tip = self.head[channel].get_tip()` inside `for channel in use_channels:` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:654-655`) | **½ by decision** | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:666` | `len(tip_spots) == len(offsets) == len(use_channels) == len(tips)` | `tips = []` then `tips.append(tip)` in a loop (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:653-658`) | (i) **unbindable** | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:726` | `error is not None` | — | (iii) | — |
| `:375` / `:383` / `:409` / `:321` | as §15.1.1 | — | (ii) | — |

**Two obstructions, both disclosed rather than discovered at gate time.** `:657` is a compound
condition whose left conjunct is a numeric `Cmp` over a tip's used volume; main spec Open decision 2
and increment 5 §14.14 item 1 keep every numeric `Cmp` outside the `volume_guards` bridge at ½, and
this guard is not a `volume_guards` entry (it calls no tracker mutator). It stays ½ and this increment
does not reopen that. `:666` binds `tips` by an **append inside a loop**, which is neither §15.3
idiom; it fails closed. `drop_tips`/`discard_tips` therefore keep a `guard_predicate_unparsed`
residual and are **not** gate candidates. `discard_tips` additionally carries `n == 0` at `:822`
(`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:1593`) whose `n = len(use_channels)` at
`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:819` sits after a conditional
rebinding of `use_channels` at `:816-817` — excluded by §15.3's rebinding clause.

**Round-1 correction to this table (C4).** `:647`'s `not_tip_spots` comprehension tests
`isinstance(ts, (TipSpot, Trash))`
(`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:645-647`). Under the **draft's**
E-TYPE, an element whose declared name is `"Container"` — which is what O1 records for a `Trash`,
since `Trash` is not in `_PLR_GENERIC_RESOURCE_NAMES` and `Container` is
(`plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:225-232`; `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/resources/trash.py:4`) —
would have evaluated `F`, making `Not(...)` `T`, `AnyOf` `T`, and the guard fire: **a false
`WILL_FAIL` on the 65 `drop_tips`/`discard_tips` operations that ran clean.** §15.4's restated E-TYPE
makes it `½` instead. This row is not a gate candidate either way; it is recorded because it was one
of round 1's two live false-`WILL_FAIL` mechanisms.

### 15.1.3 The `aspirate` / `dispense` / `transfer` closure

| PLR site | condition | tier | needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `liquid_handler.py:959`, `:1153` | `len(set(use_channels)) == len(use_channels)` | (i) | grammar + P3a |
| `liquid_handler.py:990`, `:1202` | `len(p) != len(use_channels)` — `p` is the target of `for n, p in [("resources", resources), …]` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:981-989`) | (i) **unbindable** | γ (§15.13) |
| `liquid_handler.py:875` | `len(not_containers) > 0`, `not_containers = [r for r in resources if not isinstance(r, Container)]` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:873-875`) | (i) | α + O1 |
| `liquid_handler.py:1185`, `:1188` | `self._blow_out_air_volume is None`; `requested_bav is not None and done_bav is not None and (requested_bav > done_bav)` — both under `if any(bav is not None and bav != 0.0 for bav in blow_out_air_volume)` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1179-1188`) | **do NOT clear** (round 1, C6) | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:116` | `lidded is resource` — `lidded = _lidded_ancestor(resource)` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:112`) | (ii) lid topology | — |
| `liquid_handler.py:117` | `<unconditional>` — **retiered in round 1 (C8)**: it has no operands at all, so `parse(None) = TRUE` makes it `T`, not ½, and tiering it "(ii) lid topology" mis-stated why it is undecided | **reachability-blocked** | disposed by E-UNCOND(5) ⇒ `UNKNOWN`/`guard_env_dependent` |
| `liquid_handler.py:1067`, `:1271` | `error is not None` | (iii) | — |
| `volume_tracker.py:92`, `:105` | `volume - self.get_used_volume() > 1e-06`; `volume - self.get_free_volume() > 1e-06` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/resources/volume_tracker.py:91,104`) | **already evaluated by increment 5**; residual is `volume_state_unknown` = an unseeded cell at `TOP` | (ii) observation |
| `liquid_handler.py:1335`, `:1337`, `:1340` | `ratios is not None`; `source_vol is not None`; `source_vol is None` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1333-1340`) | (i) | grammar alone |
| `:375` / `:383` / `:409` | as §15.1.1 | (ii) | — |

**Withdrawn in round 1: `:1185`/`:1188` were the draft's "cleanest result" and they do not clear.**
The draft argued that `blow_out_air_volume` defaults to `[None] * len(use_channels)` at
`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1159`, so the enclosing
`any(bav is not None and bav != 0.0 for bav in blow_out_air_volume)` at `:1183` is **F**, the guards
are unreachable, and E-SCOPE returns `SAFE`. **Two independent defects kill it, and the paragraph is
deleted rather than softened.** (1) β binds **only a length** (§15.3), and the `any(...)` scope entry
needs the *elements*; E-SCOPE gets ½, not `F`. (2) Even an element-binding extension of β would die at
`:1165`, where `blow_out_air_volume` is rebound by a comprehension that preserves the length but not,
syntactically, the elements. §15.9's `dispense` row is corrected to match. The two volume clusters
`volume_tracker.py:92`/`:105`
(`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:1165`, `:529`) remain **not** this increment's
business: increment 5 already evaluates them and their residual is an unseeded cell, not an unparsed
predicate.

**Round-1 correction to `:875` (C4b + item 13).** The draft predicted `_check_containers`'s
`len(not_containers) > 0` at
`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:871-875` would clear. It does not,
for a reason the restated E-TYPE alone would have fixed but the depth rule does not: a `Well`'s
declared name is `"Well"`, `Well` **is** a subclass of `Container`, and under §15.4's restated E-TYPE
that is now `T` ⇒ the guard is `SAFE` — **but the guard sits at `depth == 1`** inside a delegate
called positionally at `:956`, and §15.4's E-CALL(depth) forbids resolving its free names against the
entry point's `call.kwargs`. So `resources` is ⊤ and the guard is `½`/`guard_env_dependent`. Both
facts are recorded because they are separable: option (b) of §15.4's substitution disposition would
make it clear, at ~90 LOC that this increment does not spend.

**Round-1 addition (D1): `:1335`/`:1337`/`:1340` need `param_defaults`, which does not exist today.**
The draft tiered them "(i) grammar alone". `target_vols` is absent from `call.kwargs` for every
planned `transfer`, and the contract table records no parameter defaults at all — grep over
`plr-sema/data/derived_contracts.json` for `"defaults"`, `"param_defaults"` and `"signature"` returns
zero matches, and the derive package extracts none. Without a default the term is ⊤, the enclosing
`if target_vols is not None:` at `:1333` is ½, and all three guards are ½. §15.4's E-CALL(2) is
restated over a new derived `param_defaults` field, which restores them; `transfer`'s three
parameters are all `ast.Constant` `None` defaults at
`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1277-1279`.

### 15.1.4 The two families that stay out

- **The `move_*` family** — eleven clusters at `liquid_handler.py:2055`–`:2290`
  (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:685-1122`), all inside `pick_up_resource` /
  `move_picked_up_resource` / `drop_resource`. Their conditions divide into instance-state tests
  (`self.setup_finished and (not self._resource_pickups)`, `self._resource_pickup is not None`,
  `self._resource_pickup is None`) — tier (ii), receiver state the graph does not carry —
  destination-topology tests (`destination.direction == 'z'`,
  `resource_rotation_wrt_destination % 180 != 0`,
  `destination.resource is not None and destination.resource is not resource`,
  `not isinstance(resource, Plate)`,
  `isinstance(destination, ResourceStack) and destination.direction != 'z'`) — tier (ii), deck
  topology — **and one the draft's seven-condition enumeration omitted: `:2092`'s `<unconditional>`**
  (93 ops, `outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:763-774`), which is `raise e` in an
  `except` handler and is therefore **derived tier (iii)** by `is_dynamic_raise`, not a topology test
  at all (round 1, C8). Every one of the 93 ops in this family also carries the `unresolved_delegate`
  residual (§15.0), so none can clear regardless.
- **The 96-head / `stamp` family** — ten clusters at `liquid_handler.py:1743`–`:2030`
  (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:1631-2048`), 27 ops. `:1743` and `:1893`
  (`not (isinstance(resource, (Plate, Container)) or (isinstance(resource, list) and all((isinstance(w, Well) for w in resource))))`,
  `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1739-1743`) and `:1807`/`:1963`
  (`not len(containers) == 96`) are tier (i) under §15.2's `isinstance`/`all` productions;
  `:1778`/`:1940` (`not self._check_96_head_fits_in_container(container)`) and `:1804`/`:1960`
  (`well.parent != plate`, `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1801-1804`)
  are tier (ii) topology; `:1770`/`:1920` are `<unconditional>`. The family is **not excluded by rule**
  — its tier-(i) members are in scope for the grammar — but it is not a gate candidate, because
  `containers` is bound by a branch this increment does not model.
  **Round-1 correction (C1):** `:1770`/`:1920` are `<unconditional>` but their `scope_trail` is **not
  empty**. Each sits in the `else:` of a three-branch `if`/`elif`/`elif` chain
  (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1761-1773`), and `visit_If`
  pushes an `"else of: if …"` entry for every `orelse`
  (`scripts/survey_plr_preconditions.py:200-209`), an `elif` self-nesting to compound both conditions.
  E-UNCOND already blocks those — an `"else of: if …"` entry is recognised **only** by way (1), whose
  negated `isinstance` test never evaluates `T` under the restated E-TYPE. So these 54 ops were never
  in C1's false-`WILL_FAIL` population; the guards that were are `:117` (163 ops) and `:2092` (93).

## 15.2 The grammar

> **Normative (G0, the parse is a total function).** `parse : condition -> Predicate` is **total**.
> Every `condition` string produces a `Predicate`; the only escape is `Opaque`, and `Opaque` is a
> constructor of the type, not a failure. `parse(None) = TRUE` — a `None` condition means the guard
> fires unconditionally, which is what `check/__init__.py`'s `"<unconditional>"` sentinel already
> encodes (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/__init__.py:298-312`), and 9 of the shipped table's guards
> carry it. A `SyntaxError` from `ast.parse` yields `Opaque`, as `tipstate._parse_atom` already does
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:393-398`).
>
> **`parse(None) = TRUE` is a statement about the PREDICATE, never about reachability.** A guard whose
> predicate is `TRUE` still has to satisfy E-UNCOND before it may emit `WILL_FAIL`, and round 1 showed
> that the natural reading of the draft's E-UNCOND satisfied it *vacuously* on an empty `scope_trail`
> — which would have produced `WILL_FAIL` on 163 clean `aspirate`/`dispense`/`stamp`/`transfer`
> operations at `:117` and 93 `move_*` operations at `:2092`. §15.4's E-UNCOND(5) closes that, and
> **G0 must not be read as licensing it.**
>
> **`condition` is retained as the source of truth on the wire.** `InlinedGuard` gains `predicate`
> alongside its other fields — **nine in the landed dataclass**, `condition`, `predicate`,
> `scope_trail`, `raises`, `kind`, `free_vars`, `site`, `depth`, `bindings`
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:491-499`; re-anchored in round 2, A-C11 — the pre-T30b

**The grammar subsumes `tipstate`'s atom parser rather than duplicating it.** `parse_own_atom` and
`parse_bridge_atom` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:414-439`) produce a three-production
`_Atom` (`BoolView`, `NullCheck(is_none=True)`, `NullCheck(is_none=False)`,
`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:361-363`) whose truth comes from a *channel state*, not from
the call (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:442-452`). `BoolView(p)` is this grammar's
`Attr(p, has_tip)` used as a bare predicate and `NullCheck` is `Is`. **`tipstate` keeps ownership of
those two shapes and of their evaluation**: the tip family's atoms are decided by the tip lattice, and
G1's evaluator must not re-decide them. §15.4's dispatch rule is: a guard the tip family claims (its
existing `evaluate_call` selection, `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:521-536`) is skipped by the
predicate evaluator entirely; a guard the volume family claims (a `volume_guards` entry) is likewise
skipped. **One `Finding` per guard remains invariant** — the rule increment 1 §10.3.3 states and
`.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:3334-3339` records as must-not-implement.

## 15.3 The local-binding idiom

A guard's condition names free locals of the enclosing PLR method — `not_tip_spots`, `offsets`,
`missing`, `invalid_channels`. `InlinedGuard.free_vars` is `finding.mentions_params`
(`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:528`), i.e. the intersection with the *parameter* names, so
it is silent about exactly these. Resolving them in general is the dataflow pass increment 4 §13.12

**Why this is not the general dataflow pass.** Increment 4 §13.12 declined "resolving a local's type
from its assignment" as a pass with unbounded blast radius. α and β are two `ast.Assign` shapes with a
single-write requirement, matched inside one function body, producing a *term* rather than a type, and
returning `Opaque` on every ambiguity. The measured population is publishable in one table (AC-15.2),
which a general pass's is not. **The difference that matters is failure mode**: a general pass that
mis-resolves a binding produces a wrong predicate and can produce a wrong verdict; α/β, *with the
iterand clause and the depth-≥1 forbiddance of §15.4 both in force*, can only produce `Opaque`, which
is today's behaviour.

**Both qualifiers are load-bearing, and round 1 is why they are written down.** Without the iterand
clause, a future PLR that moved a comprehension below a rebinding of its own `iter` would leave α
matching and binding a term over the wrong sequence — silently wrong, with no published count moving.
Without the depth forbiddance, α's terms would be matched in the *delegate's* parameter namespace and
evaluated against the *entry point's* `call.kwargs`, a substitution nothing in the repo records:
`SurveyRecord.delegates` is a bare `set[str]` (`scripts/survey_plr_preconditions.py:163`) and
`_walk_closure` expands it by name alone (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:446-449`), so
today `_check_containers(self, resources)` resolves only because the caller's local at `:956` happens
to share the name, and `_make_sure_channels_exist(self, channels)` fails closed only because
`use_channels` at `:980` happens not to. §15.4 forbids the resolution outright and T30 publishes the
size of what is forgone. **§15.8's reason 1 survives only under both qualifiers, and §15.8 no longer
rests the registry disposition on it.**

**Interaction with the join.** `join` is unchanged
(`.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:576-581`) and stays the one function that
aggregates. A per-op `SAFE` therefore requires **every** finding on that operation to be `SAFE` — every
guard `F` or excluded by E-SCOPE, every gap absent, and every family (tip, volume) also `SAFE`. §15.5
is about whether that is reachable. **After round 1 it is not, and now structurally so**: a tier-(iii)
guard emits `UNKNOWN` (§15.5), every liquid-handling operation carries one, and one `UNKNOWN` makes the
operation `UNKNOWN`. What the draft treated as a contingent finding about tier (ii) is now also a
consequence of the fence.

## 15.5 Q1 — what a joined `SAFE` means on an operation carrying a tier-(iii) guard

Every liquid-handling operation carries `error is not None`
(`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:575-576`, `:725-726`, `:1066-1067`,
`:1270-1271`). A `SAFE` finding on it would claim the backend did not raise — which is A-COMPLETES
(`.praxia/docs/specs/260902_plr-sema-tip-typestate-increment.md:752`) applied to the *current*
operation rather than to its predecessors, and A-COMPLETES is an assumption the analyzer explicitly
does not discharge. Two options.

**(a) A scoped `SAFE`.** The report-level verdict is over the PLR precondition layer, and backend
outcomes are excluded, recorded as a `SoundnessScope` annotation. **`SoundnessScope` is NEW in this
increment** — there is no such type anywhere in `plr-sema/src/`. Main spec Open decision 2 is its
*motivation*, not its definition (round 1, C10/C18).

**(b) Never `SAFE` on such an operation.** The headline is unreachable by construction and the
increment's deliverable is the ledger delta alone.

> **Position: (a), with a disclosure that changes what the sprint can claim.** Option (b) is not a
> soundness position, it is a scope refusal: it says that because the analyzer cannot speak about the
> backend, it may not speak about PLR either. That is the same reasoning increment 5 §14.16 Q1 rejected

> `precondition_state` is "a derived guard is statically established to fire", which a backend re-raise
> is not.
>
> **What (a) means after round 1, stated so the position is not read as more than it is.** The

## 15.6 Q2 — does tier (ii) ship here or as increment 7?

> **Recommendation: DEFER to increment 7. #4981 is not started in this sprint.** The argument is not
> cost; it is that the cheap half does not work.

**The legitimacy question is settled in tier (ii)'s favour, and that is not the obstacle.** Increment 5
§14.6 records two failed `is_disabled` discharges: a second `env` member would be "a quantified claim
dressed as an observation" because a deck carries one tracker per well and per tip, and "no `.disable()`
appears in the program" is sound only if the graph is the whole world. **Neither objection applies to an
observation taken from the executed window.** `strictness`, the backend class, the deck's membership
and the head's channel count are single, observable facts about one run, and the harness already takes
`setup.snapshot()` before execution and returns `backend`. Increment 5 already built the pattern and the
cache-key partition that makes it honest (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/ir.py:918-944`). So the
*mechanism* is available and legitimate.

**The obstacle is that the one cheap member decides nothing.** The plan argues `strictness` is "the
exact `does_volume_tracking` shape and costs one `env` member"
(`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:125-129`). It is not, and the reason is
two lines above the guard. `strictness == Strictness.STRICT` at
`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:382-383` sits inside
`if len(extra) > 0 and len(vars_keyword) == 0:` at `:381`, where
`extra = backend_kws - set(args.keys())` at `:380` and `args` comes from
`inspect.signature(method)` over the **backend's own bound method** at `:353-354`. Adding `strictness`
to `env` therefore converts a ½ into a ½: the enclosing scope entry is still tier-(ii) backend, so
E-UNCOND blocks `WILL_FAIL` and E-SCOPE cannot return `SAFE`. **The cheap member is gated behind the
expensive fact in the same guard's own scope.**

So tier (ii) is all-or-nothing here: to move either `:375` or `:383` — the two clusters that block
**all 544** operations (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:39-57`, `:86-104`) — the
increment must AST-derive the backend class's method signatures.

**What defers with it:** the deck-membership observation (`:321`), the lid topology (`:116`/`:117`, and
increment 4 §13.1's lid disposition stands), the head channel count (`:409`), the well-seeding
observation that would move `volume_state_unknown`, and `can_pick_up_tip` (`:514`), which needs the
backend's *method body*, not just its signature.

## 15.7 Reasons

> **Normative — APPROVED BY THE USER 260907 (§15.14 Q4). `REASON_VOCABULARY` 10 → 12, of cap 12**
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/verdict.py:133-168` enumerates the current ten; HM-14 is `CAPPED` at
> `declared=12`, `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:613-631`, so live 12 ≤ 12 and **no
> `declared` edit is needed**). This exhausts HM-14's headroom, which is why it is the user's call and
> not the sprint's. Two members:
>
> - **`guard_operand_unknown`** — the condition parsed to a non-`Opaque` predicate and every free name
>   resolved, but an **operand of this call** is ⊤: a non-literal kwarg, a kwarg `lower_calls` renamed
>   to `?<j>` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/ir.py:796-808`), or a `RESOURCE` whose declared `type`/
>   `element_type` cannot decide an `IsInstance`.
> - **`guard_env_dependent`** — the condition parsed, but ≥ 1 free name does not resolve to a call
>   operand or to an α/β binding at all: it names instance state (`self.<x>`), a module global, a
>   backend attribute, or a local the idioms decline; **or the guard's reachability is not established
>   — `depth >= 1` (E-UNCOND(4)), or a depth-0 empty trail in a `K` containing an earlier
>   `Return`/`Try`/`Raise` (E-UNCOND(5))**; **or the guard is a derived tier-(iii) re-raise** (§15.5).
>   This is tiers (ii) **and** (iii) together, plus round 1's two new give-up points.
>
> **The one-member fallback is DEAD (the user approved two on 260907), and is kept only as the record
> of what was offered.** It was: ship `guard_env_dependent` alone
> (`REASON_VOCABULARY` 10 → 11, one slot of headroom kept) and let `guard_operand_unknown`'s
> population fold into it. The cost would have been exactly the distinction that scopes increment 7 —
> *"the analyzer needs one observation it could take"* versus *"the analyzer needs one value this call
> did not carry"* — and, concretely, §15.9's GO gate would have lost one of its two zero-conditions and
> would have had to be restated over `guard_predicate_unparsed` alone, which is a weaker gate.
>
> **The 260907 amendment adds no member and needs none.** An `EnvRef` residual is precisely *"a free
> name resolves to state outside the call"* — the first clause of `guard_env_dependent`'s own
> definition above, of which `self.<x>` is the first example it names. What the amendment changes is
> that the analyzer can now say so about a shape it previously could not read at all; the vocabulary
> stays at the approved 12 and HM-14 stays at zero headroom.

**Against increment 1 §10.8's criterion, which is the right instrument.** That section's argument for
`channel_state_unknown` is that `guard_predicate_unparsed` means "could not be turned into a
predicate", which becomes a **false statement** for a guard the analyzer does parse, and that main spec
§0's rule requires a reason to name *which pipeline stage returned nothing* —
"the parse stage returned something; the *evaluation* stage did not"
(`.praxia/docs/specs/260902_plr-sema-tip-typestate-increment.md:992-998`). Both new members are
evaluation-stage give-up points and both are mechanical (they name our own give-up point, not a
semantic property), so §3.3's hand-maintenance justification carries over unchanged. They are
distinguishable from each other by a purely mechanical test — *did every free name resolve?* — which is
what keeps them from being one member split into two for appearance's sake (§9.4's anti-gaming
concern, `.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:2429-2431`).

**Three members were considered and rejected, each for a stated reason.**

- **`guard_predicate_opaque`: rejected.** `guard_predicate_unparsed` already means exactly that, and an
  `Opaque` predicate is precisely "could not be turned into a predicate". Adding it would be a rename
  costing a vocabulary slot. **`Opaque` keeps `guard_predicate_unparsed`**, which also makes the ledger
  delta legible: the residual `guard_predicate_unparsed` count *is* the grammar's coverage gap —
  **but only under the nested-`Opaque` rule below, which round 1 showed the draft needed and lacked,
  and only under G7's PLR-layer test on shape (2), which round 2 showed the amendment needed and
  lacked (A-C1).** Without that test a `self.<name>(…)` naming a method the closure could have inlined
  would leave `guard_predicate_unparsed` while gaining no coverage — ≥ 41 findings at this pin from
  `self._is_error_tail(response)` alone — and this sentence would be false in the same stroke.

> **Normative (nested `Opaque` — round 1, C15).** **A predicate containing ANY `Opaque` node is
> `Opaque` for reason-assignment purposes** (i.e. it keeps `guard_predicate_unparsed`), while still
> being **evaluated** under Kleene — so an `And` with an `F` conjunct still decides. Two lines, no
> vocabulary cost.
>
> **Without it the three-reason taxonomy has a hole, and §15.7's own legibility claim is false.**
> §15.3's own worked example creates it: `invalid_channels = [c for c in channels if c not in
> self.head]` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:405-409`) — α binds
> the term, the `if` clause parses `Opaque`, and every free name resolves. The guard
> `not len(invalid_channels) == 0` is then not `guard_predicate_unparsed` (the top node parsed), not
> `guard_operand_unknown` (no call operand is ⊤; the failure is syntactic, inside the comprehension),

> there are **384 such findings** (`outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_before.json:133-140`).
> Under the rule they stay `guard_predicate_unparsed`, which is what makes the ledger delta a coverage
> measure a reader can interpret rather than an overstatement.

> **Normative (the `EnvRef` reason rule — new in the 260907 amendment, REORDERED in round 2 (A-C5); it

>
> 1. **`contains_opaque` ⇒ `guard_predicate_unparsed`.** Unchanged. The nested-`Opaque` rule above is
>    unchanged. Any `Opaque` node anywhere still means *"the grammar failed here"*.
> 2. **Else, if an operand of *this call* is ⊤ ⇒ `guard_operand_unknown`.** Unchanged in content, moved
>    **ahead** of the `contains_env_ref` clause. **The gate has two zero-conditions and the amendment
>    may relax neither**; leaving the `EnvRef` clause first would have relabelled `self.backend.f(<x>)`
>    — where `<x>` is a non-literal kwarg, or one renamed to `?<j>` in the lowered `kwargs`
>    (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/ir.py:796-808`) — as `guard_env_dependent` when §15.7's own
>    definition (above) says it is `guard_operand_unknown`. At this pin the exposure is nil, because O1
>    drives `guard_operand_unknown` to 0 everywhere
>    (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:1143-1146`); the rule is wrong independently of the
>    pin, and the shape it is wrong about — an `EnvRef` with `Term` arguments — is precisely the one
>    the amendment introduces. AC-15.5(iii) pins it with a fixture.
> 3. **Else, if `contains_env_ref` and the guard is still undecided ⇒ `guard_env_dependent`.**
>    The grammar **recognised** the read; what is missing is an observation, not a production. This is
>    the same member §15.5 already assigns to a derived tier-(iii) re-raise and to an unestablished

> **`:409` is the worked example, and the amendment moves it from clause (1) to clause (3).** It does

- **A third member separating tier (iii) from tier (ii): rejected.** It would be a 13th and the cap
  conversation is the user's, not the sprint's
  (`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:130-131`). The (ii)/(iii) distinction is
  published in §15.9's measured set, where it belongs, rather than encoded in a wire vocabulary.
- **Shipping only `guard_operand_unknown`: considered, and rejected as the weaker option.** It would
  collapse "the analyzer needs one observation it could take" into "the analyzer needs one value this
  call did not carry", which is exactly the distinction the next increment is scoped by. **This is the
  cheaper fallback if the user declines to exhaust HM-14's headroom** (§15.14 Q4).

**Cap consequence, stated rather than buried: if the user approves, after this increment
`REASON_VOCABULARY` is at 12 of 12 and HM-14 has zero headroom.** Any future give-up point then needs
the cap conversation. Round 1's own argument for approving is that item 3's widening of
`guard_env_dependent` to cover unestablished reachability makes that member carry strictly more
traffic than the draft anticipated, which sharpens rather than blurs the distinction from
`guard_operand_unknown`.

## 15.8 Registry

**New rows: zero. Retired rows: zero. Per-row ceilings proposed to move: zero.** `live_rows()` is 24
(`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:957-961`) against `BUDGET_CAP = 24`
(`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:43`) before and after. Headroom 0, unchanged.

**The question the round must decide: does the local-binding idiom belong on HM-24 (ceiling 3 → 4) or
HM-25 (8 → 9)?** The registry's own criterion is silent-versus-loud: HM-24 is the pattern "whose
failure mode is a SILENT family collapse rather than a loud exact-count test failure"
(`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:841-896`), while HM-25's `breaks_when` records "Fails
LOUDLY here (unlike HM-24)" (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:934-951`).

> **APPROVED BY THE USER, 260907 — HM-25 `declared` 8 → 9** (recommendation was: spend it;
> `.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:262-265`). The
> draft's position was *"neither row"*; round 1 broke the leg it rested on and the position is
> withdrawn. **α and β are filed as one HM-25 entry** — an "argument-default and filtered-comprehension
> binding shapes" pattern — with `breaks_when` naming **AC-15.2's exact floor as the loud test**.
> `live_rows()` stays 24 against `BUDGET_CAP = 24`
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:43`, `:957-961`); **no row is added**, so no cap
> conversation is opened. AC-15.7 asserts HM-25 `declared == 9` unconditionally; the "if the user
> declines, α and β ship unregistered at `declared == 8`" branch is **dead** and is retained only in
> §15.14 Q5 as the record of what was asked.
>
> **Why HM-25 and not HM-24, which is what the challenger proposed.** The registry's criterion is
> silent-versus-loud. (1) HM-24's harm is a *silent family collapse* —
> *"the tip-requiring/tip-loading families silently empty"*
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:874-880`). α's failure returns one guard to
> `guard_predicate_unparsed`, its pre-increment reason, and empties **no family**; there is no family
> here. (2) AC-15.2 publishes an exact floor that goes red on a PLR rewrite, which is HM-25's own
> criterion verbatim — *"Fails LOUDLY here (unlike HM-24) … exact-count/gate assertions … go red"*
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:945-948`). (3) HM-25's `what` **already carries P3a** as
> `<p> = <p> or self.<x> or list(range(len(<q>)))`
> (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:899-906`) — β's three-operand sibling, same idiom family,
> same row. The B1 precedent the challenger invoked went to HM-24 because *"R1 (§14.6) makes its
> `ast.For` node load-bearing for SOUNDNESS"* (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:855-861`),
> which is a claim about a *loop-recognition* rule, not about a binding shape whose failure is a
> published count going red.
>
> **The draft's own reasoning, kept for the record, and where it fails.** Three reasons, in decreasing
> strength; **reason 1 no longer survives unqualified**.
>
> 1. **The failure mode is neither silent nor a collapse.** If PLR rewrites
>    `not_tip_spots = [ts for ts in tip_spots if not isinstance(ts, TipSpot)]` as a `filter(...)` call
>    or a generator, α binds nothing, the term is `Opaque`, and the guard emits
>    `guard_predicate_unparsed` — **the pre-increment behaviour**, not a wrong verdict and not an
>    emptied family. Contrast HM-24's own `breaks_when`, whose harm is that "the tip-requiring /

>    coverage number.
> 2. **That number is a published gate, so the failure is loud by construction.** AC-15.2 requires the
>    complete α/β selection to be published with a floor, and AC-15.3 requires the per-op residual. A
>    PLR rewrite that broke α would move a published count and fail an exact-count assertion — which is
>    HM-25's *loud* criterion, not HM-24's, and having satisfied the loud criterion the pattern needs no
>    row to make it loud.
> 3. **α and β are Python language constructs, not PLR idioms** — a list comprehension with a filter,
>    and an `or`-chain default — which is verbatim the argument increment 5 §14.11 already accepted for
>    B2 and P1c (`.praxia/docs/specs/260903_plr-sema-volume-increment.md:930-934`). The one place that

increment adds no component and threads no new value. But `contracts_sha` is
`sha256(contracts_json)`, computed at `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/ir.py:946`, and T30 **regenerates
`plr-sema/data/derived_contracts.json`** to add `predicate` and `param_defaults`. **So every key moves,
for every caller, not just the benchmark: the cache is cold after T30 by design.** O1 additionally
moves `bc_hash` for the benchmark, for the same reason. The draft's *"every key it produces is
byte-identical to today's"* was false and sat in the same paragraph as "the benchmark's keys move".
**The property that actually matters is that `env` is untouched** — no partitioning, no correctness
event, a full re-computation. T30's gate includes checking that no test pins a literal `cache_key`.
Under Q2-defer, `strictness` never enters `env`.

## 15.9 Measured sets (band B, T30)

> **Normative (the report file names, corrected against what band B actually wrote; 260907, extended
> in round 2 for the landed population re-run).** There are now **three** reports and each means
> something different:
>
> 1. **`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json`** — the first measurement, the one that recorded
>    NO-GO. The draft's text said `t30_measured_260904.json` and no such file was written (§15.15's
>    T30 row, divergence 3).
> 2. **`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260907.json`** — the **population re-run**, commit `15b84d31`.
>    Fix-up (1) below has **already landed**: `t30_measure.py` now sources the executed set from
>    `oracle_replay.main()` itself via `collect_executed_population`
>    (`plr-sema/eval/t30_measure.py:19-38`, `:550`), and the measured population is **544 /
>    `pick_up_tips` 223**. The named cause of the earlier 923 / 361 is recorded in the script's own
>    docstring: `row_to_verifier_inputs` was called **without** the sidecar's `ambiguity_class`, which
>    directly sets `skip_reason` there, so every non-`"clean_parse"` row `run_row` would have skipped
>    was silently admitted (`plr-sema/eval/t30_measure.py:25-35`). This report carries **no** amendment
>    effect — the grammar is unchanged in it.
> 3. **`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260908.json` or later** — the amendment's own re-measurement,
>    produced by **T35** after the grammar lands, and **the GO/NO-GO that decides whether T31 starts is
>    the one recorded there.**
>
> All three are kept. The amendment's evidence is the delta between (2) and (3) — same population,
> different grammar — and **not** the delta between (1) and (3), which confounds the two changes. No
> number from an earlier report is republished as if it were a later one.

> **Normative.** The measured report publishes, computed over the whole
> `plr-sema/data/derived_contracts.json` and over the frozen benchmark's own lowered IR calls (via
> `lower_row_calls`, `plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:551-571`, with no analyzer change and no
> `check_ir` invocation):
>
> 1. **Parse coverage.** Of all guards in the contract table: the count parsing to a non-`Opaque`
>    predicate, broken down **per atom kind** (`Cmp`, chained `Cmp`, `Is`, `IsInstance`, `AllOf`/
>    `AnyOf`, `SetOf`-uniqueness, `Filtered`-emptiness, `TRUE`), and the count remaining `Opaque` with
>    the ten most frequent unparsed shapes named.
> 2. **Binding coverage.** The complete set of `(K, x, idiom, term)` tuples α and β bind, and the count
>    of guards with ≥ 1 free local of which every / some / no local binds. **Plus two counts round 1
>    requires**: (i) the number of executed `pick_up_tips` operations for which `channels_for_call`
>    returns non-`None` (D2, floor `== 223`), and (ii) the number of depth-≥1 guards whose free vars
>    *would* have resolved by name coincidence against the entry point's kwargs had E-CALL(depth) not
>    forbidden it (item 13), so the size of what is forgone is on the record.
> 3. **Per ledger cluster** (all 54): the predicted tier, `parsed?`, `bound?`, and **the reason the
>    guard ACTUALLY carries** after §15.7. §15.1's (i)/(ii) tiering is a prediction; this block is the
>    measurement, and any divergence between them is published rather than absorbed. **Amendment
>    additions**: **`n_env_ref_nodes`** — the number of `EnvRef` **nodes** in that cluster's
>    α/β-substituted predicate (renamed from `n_env_ref` in round 2, A-C8: block (3) and block (4)
>    published the same name in two different units, and `:2055` — one guard, two nodes — is the cell
>    where that bites) — and `env_ref_paths`, the dotted paths themselves, so a reader can see exactly
>    what the production absorbed, per site, without reading this document.
> 4. **Per executed operation**: the residual **reason set**, plus the residual tier set as a published
>    annotation, plus — separately — the count of guards on that operation that are `parsed but
>    operand-unknown`, so a residual caused by a missing declared type is distinguishable from a
>    genuinely environmental one. **Amendment additions**: `n_env_ref` — **per-guard, and this block is
>    the only place that name carries that unit** (round 2, A-C8): the number of guards on that
>    operation whose α/β-substituted predicate contains ≥ 1 `EnvRef` node; and
>    `n_decided_via_env_ref_shortcircuit`, the number of guards that reach a definite value only
>    because an `EnvRef`-containing compound short-circuited over an already-decidable conjunct
>    (§15.4 E-ENV), predicted **0**. **No sibling counters for the vacuous-`Zip` and membership paths
>    are published, because round 2 closed both by rule rather than by measurement** (§15.4 E-ENV) —
>    that is the point of the theorem, and a counter for a path the semantics forbids would be
>    theatre.
> 5. **The O1 delta**: (4) computed twice, with and without §15.4's operand observation. If the two
>    differ by zero, O1 is not doing what §15.4 claims and the gate is re-opened.
> 6. **The amendment's own surface (new, 260907; one field added in round 2).** Over the whole contract
>    table: the **top-10 `EnvRef` paths by occurrence** with their counts; `n_env_ref_guards` and
>    `n_env_ref_nodes`; `n_zip`; `n_membership_cmp`; **`n_var_self`, asserted `== 0`** (§15.2's
>    `Var("self")` invariant); `n_opaque_only_by_var_self`, the guards that are `Opaque` *only* because
>    that invariant fired, predicted **0** and published rather than assumed; and — **new in round 2,
>    A-C1 — `n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer`**, the number of shape-(2) candidates refused by G7's
>    PLR-layer test, i.e. `self.<name>(…)` calls whose `<name>` is an indexed method of the receiver
>    class. **This is the field that keeps the top-10 path list interpretable**: without the test those
>    calls would have populated it, and with the test their count is visible instead of invisible. It
>    is predicted **non-zero** — `self._is_error_tail(response)` alone contributes 41 condition strings
>    to the contract table, and `:1778`/`:1940`'s
>    `not self._check_96_head_fits_in_container(container)` two more. Block (1)'s `top10_unparsed_shapes` is
>    republished so the shapes the amendment did **not** absorb stay visible: at the pre-amendment
>    measurement two of the ten are membership tests over a `self` chain and three are `self`-rooted
>    but subscripted or arithmetic (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:21-62`), and the second
>    group must still be `Opaque` afterwards.

**Round 1's prediction table, kept as the record of what was predicted BEFORE band B measured — it was
falsified on one row and that is what the amendment exists for.** The `pick_up_tips` row predicted
`{guard_env_dependent}` ⇒ GO; the measurement returned the residual reason set
`decidable+guard_env_dependent+guard_predicate_unparsed` on every `pick_up_tips` occurrence
(`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:1045-1051`), and the `gate` block records `go` false for
both the with-O1 and the without-O1 computation
(`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:1149-1162`). Every other row's prediction held.

| method | ops | predicted residual (reasons) | the guards that must clear, and how |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`pick_up_tips`** | 223 | **{`guard_env_dependent`} — GO** | `liquid_handler.py:498` clears (α + O1 + restated E-TYPE ⇒ `IsInstance` `T` ⇒ `Not` `F` ⇒ `AnyOf` `F` ⇒ `SAFE`); `:502` clears (G4 + `channels_for_call`, **conditional on D2**); `:522` clears (G2 + β + E-CALL(β) + `channels_for_call`); `:514`/`:375`/`:383`/`:409`/`:321` are `guard_env_dependent`; `:576` is derived (iii) ⇒ `guard_env_dependent` + `excludes_sites`; `:535` is already decided |
| `transfer` | 19 | {`guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | `:1335`/`:1337`/`:1340` **now clear via D1's `param_defaults`** (they did **not** on the grammar alone), but `transfer` inherits `aspirate`'s `:990` and `dispense`'s `:1202`, which need γ |
| `aspirate` | 77 | {`guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | `:959` clears; **`:875` does NOT** (E-CALL(depth) forbids the depth-1 resolution); `:990` needs γ; `:117` is `guard_env_dependent` under E-UNCOND(5) |
| `dispense` | 40 | {`guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | `:1153` clears; **`:1185`/`:1188` do NOT** (β binds no elements, C6); `:1202` needs γ |
| `drop_tips` / `discard_tips` | 65 | {`guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | `:666` binds `tips` by loop-append and `:657` is a numeric `Cmp`; both fail closed (§15.1.2). `:647` is now `½` rather than a **false `WILL_FAIL`** (C4) |
| `stamp` | 27 | {`guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | `containers` is branch-bound (§15.1.4); `:1770`/`:1920` are `guard_env_dependent`, not false `WILL_FAIL` |
| `move_resource` / `move_lid` / `move_plate` | 93 | out of scope — `unresolved_delegate` (§15.0) | `:2092` is derived (iii) |

**The re-prediction under the 260907 amendment as revised in round 2, per candidate method, with the
measured blocker named and its disposition argued from its own syntax.** Operation counts are the
ledger's frozen population (§15.0). **The last column is a `guards / nodes` pair, in the two units
blocks (4) and (3) respectively publish** (round 2, A-C8 — one name in two units was the defect):
`guards` is block (4)'s per-operation `n_env_ref`, the number of that operation's guards whose
α/β-substituted predicate contains ≥ 1 `EnvRef` node; `nodes` is the sum of block (3)'s
`n_env_ref_nodes` over those guards. **Hedged ranges are gone** — each cell is either an exact pair or
the words *not predicted*, because a hedged cell is unfalsifiable in exactly the place the ambiguity
bit. Every cell is a prediction for **T35** to falsify.

| method | ops | measured blocker(s) carrying `guard_predicate_unparsed` | flips? | re-predicted residual | expected `n_env_ref` guards / nodes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`pick_up_tips`** | 223 | `:409` `not len(invalid_channels) == 0`, whose α-bound filter is `c not in self.head`; `:514` `not all(self.backend.can_pick_up_tip(channel, tip) for channel, tip in zip(use_channels, tips))` | **both** — G8's `not in` + G7 shape (1) under the α-substituted walk; G8's `Zip` + G7 shape (2), admitted because `("self", "backend", "can_pick_up_tip")` has length 3 | **{`decidable`, `guard_env_dependent`} ⇒ GO** | **2 / 2** |
| `drop_tips` / `discard_tips` | 65 | `:657` `tip.tracker.get_used_volume() > 0 and (not allow_nonzero_volume)` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:763-772`) | **no** — rooted at the local `tip`, not at `self`; the closed negative list's "call rooted at a parameter or local" row | {`decidable`, `guard_env_dependent`, `guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | **1 / 1** (`:409` only, reached via `self._make_sure_channels_exist(use_channels)` at `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:665`) |
| `aspirate` | 77 | `:116` `lidded is resource` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:543-552`) | **no** — an `is` comparison whose RHS is not the constant `None`, so it is not the `Is` production; no `self` anywhere in it | {…, `guard_predicate_unparsed`} — NO-GO | **1 / 1** (`:409`, via `self._make_sure_channels_exist(use_channels)` at `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:980`) |
| `dispense` | 40 | `:116`, as `aspirate` | **no** | NO-GO | **1 / 1** (`:1185` only — `dispense` does **not** reach `:409`; `_make_sure_channels_exist` has exactly three call sites, `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:521`, `:665`, `:980`, and none is in `dispense`) |
| `transfer` | 19 | `:116`, inherited | **no** | NO-GO | **not predicted** — it certainly contains `:409` (inherited from `aspirate`) and `:1185` (from `dispense`), so ≥ 2 / ≥ 2, but this document has not enumerated `transfer`'s full closure and will not publish a number it cannot derive |
| `stamp` | 27 | `:116`; `:2030` `(source.num_items_x, source.num_items_y) == (target.num_items_x, target.num_items_y)` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:953-962`); `:1778`/`:1940` `not self._check_96_head_fits_in_container(container)` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:873-882`) | **none** — round 2 moved `:1778`/`:1940` to no-flip (A-C1: a length-2 `self.<name>(…)` naming an indexed `LiquidHandler` method, refused by G7's PLR-layer test, and its body reads no receiver state); `:116` and `:2030` do not flip either — a tuple *display* is not a `Term` in G1 and the amendment adds none | NO-GO | **0 / 0** — and both refused calls appear in `n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer` instead |
| `move_resource` / `move_lid` / `move_plate` | 93 | `:2055` `self.setup_finished and (not self._resource_pickups)` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:613-622`); `:2211` `resource_rotation_wrt_destination % 180 != 0`; `:2226` `destination.resource is not None and destination.resource is not resource` | `:2055` **flips** (two `EnvRef` leaves in predicate position — the shape the unamended walk had no production for); `:2211` does not (an arithmetic `BinOp` is not a `Term`); `:2226` does not (`is not resource`) | out of scope regardless — `unresolved_delegate` (§15.0) | **4 / 5** — `:2055` (1 guard, 2 nodes) plus the three single-leaf `self._resource_pickup` guards (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260907.json:625`, `:645`, `:655`). **This is the cell the A-C8 unit collision was hiding**: the old "4–5" was one count under each definition, not a range |

**Three predictions in that table are about reasons that do NOT change, and they are the ones worth
attacking first.** (1) `volume_tracker.py:92`/`:105` are the volume family's, by the dispatch rule
(§15.2), and keep `volume_state_unknown` — the pre-amendment measurement reported
`guard_predicate_unparsed` for them
(`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:733-742`), which is the family-dispatch fix-up below, not
an amendment effect; either way they are not one of the gate's two zero-conditions, so
`aspirate`/`dispense` are blocked by `:116` alone. (2) `:1185`'s `self._blow_out_air_volume is None`
already parsed and was reported `decidable_or_operand_dependent`
(`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:803-812`); under G7 it becomes
`Is(EnvRef(("self", "_blow_out_air_volume")), negated=False)` and its reason is predicted to **change
to `guard_env_dependent`** — a prediction that would be a *regression* if `EnvRef` were merely
cosmetic, and that is instead the `Var("self") ∈ K_params` defect being fixed. (3) `n_findings_decided`
is predicted **unchanged** by the amendment alone.

**So the gate rests on `pick_up_tips` alone, and it now has three points of failure, not one.** All
three are measurable in T30 **before** T31 constructs a single verdict, which is exactly what the
ordering gate above exists for:

1. **O1's element walk must yield `"TipSpot"`** for `tip_spots`' cells. If it does not, `:498` is ½,
   `pick_up_tips` keeps a `guard_operand_unknown` residual, and the increment is NO-GO on every
   operation. §15.9(5) measures O1's effect directly rather than assuming it. O1 is ~40 LOC (§15.4),
   not the ~25 the draft claimed.
2. **`channels_for_call` must return an exact tuple on 223 real rows** (D2). `:502`'s
   `len(set(use_channels)) == len(use_channels)` clears only then. The path for `pick_up_tips` is
   `channel_default_param["pick_up_tips"] == "tip_spots"` → `call.kwargs["tip_spots"]` must be an
   `ir.Seq` → `tuple(range(len(items)))`
   (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:262-269`); that should hold, since `tip_spots` is a
   trusted param and so is not renamed `?<j>` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/ir.py:796-808`). **But no
   number anywhere covers the tier-1 benchmark**, and `tipstate.py` itself records that *"the shipped
   fixture's operations never resolve an exact channel set"*
   (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:551-565`). If the measured count is 0 the gate fails on
   `:502` for a reason unrelated to the grammar, and without this block §15.9 would have misattributed
   it to O1.
3. **`tip_spots` must lower as an `ir.Seq`**, which (2) depends on and which block (2) also exposes.

**Measured (T30): all three points of failure held, and the gate failed on none of them.**
`channels_for_call` returned non-`None` on **every** executed `pick_up_tips` operation the script
counted (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:64-68`, `d2`), `tip_spots` lowered as an `ir.Seq`
on all of them, and with O1 the `guard_operand_unknown` count is **0** everywhere, the O1 delta
differing on 389 operations (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:1143-1146`). **The gate failed
on a fourth thing this list did not contain** — two guards whose conditions the grammar could not read
at all — which is the amendment's subject and is why the list is left standing rather than rewritten:
it was a correct list of the risks that were foreseen, and the one that fired was not among them. D2's
floor `== 223` is reported as 361/361 under the script's own population, which is fix-up (1) above,
not a second failure.

**On `:522` surviving C6 and C14 together, explicitly, because round 1 disputed it.** `offsets` is
written **exactly once** in `pick_up_tips` — the β assignment at
`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:517`; `:493` is a kwarg pass inside
`_log_command`, not a write — so C6's eight-second-writes finding does not reach it. The "β is
unreachable" attack rested on E-CALL step (2) returning a signature default of `None`; step (2) had
**no data source at all** before D1, and after D1 it returns `Lit(None)`, which is statically
known-falsy and which E-CALL(β) case (3) routes to the β binding. Both paths end at
`Len(offsets) = Len(tip_spots)`. **The gate keeps a predicted GO candidate.**

---

## 15.10 The oracle and the fence

**Tier 1 re-run is the gate: 0 unsound, under the UNMODIFIED predicate.** A `SAFE` on an operation that
raised is the failure this increment makes possible **for the first time** — increments 1–5 could
produce `WILL_FAIL` and per-finding `SAFE`, but no path from a parsed condition to a `SAFE` on a guard
the analyzer previously declined. Round 1 deleted the draft's narrowing (§15.5): the predicate stays
exactly `plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:645-647`, and `rows_excused_by_scope` is published as an
annotation with **no threshold and no gate effect**. T32 contains no reference to `exc_class` in the
comparison path.

**The other direction — a false `WILL_FAIL` on an operation that ran clean — is the one round 1 found
live, and it is now fenced by construction rather than by measurement.** `compare` scores
`verdict == "will_fail" and outcome == "ran_ok"` as unsound at the same three lines, and `join`
propagates one such finding to the whole operation. E-UNCOND(4)/(5) and the restated E-TYPE are the
three clauses that stop it; AC-15.6's fixture set asserts each by name.

**Non-regression, each re-measured and published, any movement attributed before the run is accepted:**
m1 199/199, m2 289/289, v1 67/67 `WILL_FAIL` at the raised index, tier 2b 16 fixtures with
`region_unsound` 0 and `region_will_fail_fired` 7, tier 1 `rows_executed` 343 / `setup_error` 0 /
crosscheck 191/191, and the spec lint at 24 passed with six specs at zero failing citations
(`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:144-151`).

**The ledger after-run.** `outputs/plr-sema/unknown_ledger_260904_after.json`, produced by the same
script with no change, plus a published delta over: `n_findings_by_reason`, `n_clusters`, and the
`per_op_reason_set_histogram`. **`unknown_rate` is expected to stay 1.0** under §15.5's finding, and
that expectation is recorded here so a 1.0 at close is read as "predicted", not as "the increment did
nothing".

> **The `guard_predicate_unparsed` 5,656 is published with NO floor — round 1, C5.** The draft made it
> the headline with a floor of ≥ 1,000 converted. That floor is met by the **reason rename alone**:
> `:375`'s `len(missing) > 0` (544 findings) and `:383`'s `strictness == Strictness.STRICT` (544)
> both parse to non-`Opaque` predicates under G1 and both decide **nothing** — their free names

## 15.11 Acceptance criteria

- **AC-15.1 (the grammar is total, and `Opaque` is its only escape).** Over the whole shipped
  `derived_contracts.json`, `parse` returns for **every** guard without raising, and the count of
  non-`Opaque` results is published. Six fixtures pin the productions, one apiece: a chained
  comparison of three `Len`s yields two conjoined `Cmp`s and evaluates `F` when the *second* conjunct
  is `F` and the first is ½; `len(<Filtered>) > 0` yields `AnyOf` and `len(<Filtered>) == 0` yields its
  negation; `len(set(x)) == len(x)` on `[0, 1, 1]` is `T` for the guard's polarity and on `[0, 1]` is
  `F`; `x is None` / `x is not None` on a `Lit(null)` kwarg are exact opposites; an `assert`-kind guard
  fires on `F` and a `raise_guard` on `T` for the identical condition string (G6); and an unrecognised
  shape — `c not in self.head` (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:407`)
  — yields `Opaque` and a `guard_predicate_unparsed` finding **identical to the one emitted today**.
  The last is the stub-defeating half: an implementation that raised, or that emitted a new reason for
  an unparsed guard, fails it. **Plus three round-1 fixtures on E-TYPE and nesting**:
  `IsInstance(declared="Container", (TipSpot, Trash))` is **½** (not `F` — C4a's false-`WILL_FAIL`
  mechanism); `IsInstance(declared="Well", (Container,))` is **`T`** (not ½ — C4b); and a predicate
  whose top node parses but which contains an `Opaque` sub-node keeps `guard_predicate_unparsed` while
  still evaluating `F` when conjoined with an `F` conjunct (C15).
  **Plus the 260907 amendment's fixture set, positive and negative, one apiece.** *Positive*:
  `c not in self.head` parses to `Cmp(Var("c"), "not in", EnvRef(("self", "head"), None))` with
  `contains_opaque` false and `contains_env_ref` true;
  `not all(self.backend.can_pick_up_tip(channel, tip) for channel, tip in zip(use_channels, tips))`
  parses to `Not(AllOf(Zip((Var("use_channels"), Var("tips"))), EnvRef(("self", "backend",
  "can_pick_up_tip"), (Var("channel"), Var("tip")))))`, non-`Opaque`, and evaluates ½ against a call
  supplying both kwargs; `self.setup_finished and (not self._resource_pickups)` parses to an `And` of
  two `EnvRef` leaves **in predicate position**; and `self._resource_pickup is None` parses to
  `Is(EnvRef(…), negated=False)` rather than to `Is(Attr(Var("self"), …), …)`, asserted as the
  normalisation. *Negative — the closed list of §15.2 G7, one fixture per row*: a call whose callee is
  not `self`-rooted; `self.head[channel].has_tip` (subscripted); `f(self)` (`self` as an argument);
  `tip.tracker.get_used_volume()` (rooted at a local); `volume - self.get_used_volume() > 1e-06`
  (arithmetic `BinOp`); a `zip(...)` under `Len` rather than as a `seq`; and a tuple-target
  comprehension whose arity differs from its `Zip`'s. Every one yields `Opaque` and a
  `guard_predicate_unparsed` finding **identical to the one emitted today**. **Two whole-table
  assertions carry the invariant**: `n_var_self == 0` over the regenerated contract table, and
  `n_findings_decided` unchanged by the amendment alone. **The stub-defeating halves are the negative
  list and the `n_var_self` assertion**: an implementation that admitted any `self`-rooted text as an
  `EnvRef` passes every positive fixture and fails these.
  **Plus round 2's five fixtures, gated on T35 (§15.12), one per objection they close.**
  (a) *The PLR-layer test (A-C1)*: `not self._check_96_head_fits_in_container(container)` yields
  `Opaque` and `guard_predicate_unparsed` — asserted **negative**, reversing spec_version 18's
  positive example — while `self.backend.can_pick_up_tip(channel, tip)` stays an `EnvRef`; and
  `n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer > 0` over the regenerated table. **This is round 2's stub-defeating
  half**: an implementation that skipped the index test passes every other fixture in this criterion
  and fails this one. (b) *`Zip` resolution (A-C3)*: `AllOf(Zip(Seq([]), ⊤), <½ body>)` evaluates
  **½**, asserted **not `T`** — the vacuous-quantification false-`SAFE` mechanism — and
  `Zip((Seq[8], ⊤))` is asserted to resolve ⊤ rather than to an 8-element sequence. (c) *The
  α/β-substituted walk (A-C4)*: `contains_env_ref` is **true** for the substituted `:409` guard —
  `not len(invalid_channels) == 0` with `invalid_channels` bound to
  `Filtered(Var("channels"), Cmp(Var("c"), "not in", EnvRef(("self", "head"), None)))` — and
  **false** for its raw `predicate` field, so an implementer who walked the wrong tree fails visibly.
  (d) *Membership decides nothing (A-C2/A-C10)*: `x in ['a', 'b']` yields `Opaque` (no
  literal-container `Term`), and a membership `Cmp` whose RHS **does** resolve to a concrete `Seq` of
  `Lit`s evaluates **½**, asserted **not** `T`/`F`. (e) *The `args` round-trip (A-C12)*: `self.head`
  parses with `args is None` and a zero-argument shape-(2) call with a length-3 path (written
  `self.backend.<m>()` in the fixture, synthetic by design — the distinction under test is `None` vs
  `()`, not a PLR API) parses with `args == ()`, and **both survive `to_json`/`from_json` unchanged**,
  so JSON `null` and `[]` do not collapse into each other on the wire.
- **AC-15.2 (the two idioms bind, are measured, and fail closed).** The complete
  `(K, x, idiom, term)` selection over the whole PLR surface is published with **≥ 3** α entries
  (`liquid_handler.py:496`, `:645`, `:873`) and **≥ 6** β entries — a floor **met by measurement, not
  by assertion**: the expected β population at this pin is **exactly eight** (`:517`, `:661`, `:963`,
  `:964`, `:965`, `:1157`, `:1158`, `:1159`), with `offsets` at `:962`/`:1156` correctly excluded.
  Five fail-closed fixtures, one apiece: a second write to `x` anywhere in `K` binds nothing; an
  assignment nested in an `if` that does not contain the guard binds nothing; a three-operand `or`
  chain whose middle operand is `self.<x>` binds nothing under β **and is instead resolved by the
  existing `channels_for_call`** (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:245-270`), asserted through
  the receiver's **derived** `channel_kwarg`/`channel_default_param` and never through a hand-typed
  `"use_channels"` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/check/tipstate.py:254-257`); an assignment *after* the
  guard's `lineno` binds nothing; and a guard whose `scope_trail` contains a `for` header targeting
  `x` binds nothing. The last two are the stub-defeating halves: an implementation matching on shape
  alone, without the position and scope tests, passes the first three and fails these.
  **Plus six round-1 fixtures.** Two on the β-preserving rebinding: `x = [f(e) for e in x]` preserves a
  β length binding, and `x = [f(a, b) for a, b in zip(y, x)]` does **not**. One on the iterand: a
  second write to α's `iter` name binds nothing. Three on E-CALL(β)'s truthiness branches, one per
  case, including **`offsets=[]` asserted to resolve to the β length and NOT to `Len == 0`** — the
  latter would be a false `WILL_FAIL` at `:522`, which is the stub-defeating half of this group.
- **AC-15.3 (the measured sets are published and the gate is decided by them).**
  The measured report carries all six blocks of §15.9 — the first as
  `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json`, the amendment's re-measurement as
  `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260908.json` — and the GO/NO-GO
  decision is recorded against the published **per-op reason set** — GO iff ≥ 1 executed real
  operation carries zero `guard_predicate_unparsed` and zero `guard_operand_unknown` findings.
  **The gate number is asserted computable from the JSON alone, without reading this document.**
  `pick_up_tips` is asserted **by name** to be that operation, or the divergence is recorded in §15.15
  and the decision goes to the user before AC-15.5's work starts. Block (3) additionally publishes,
  per cluster, the reason each guard **actually** carries against §15.1's predicted tier, and any
  divergence is recorded rather than absorbed.
  **Plus the 260907 amendment's publication requirements, gated on T35 (§15.12) and each asserted
  present and non-null in the re-measured JSON**: **`n_env_ref_nodes`** and `env_ref_paths` per cluster
  (block 3); **`n_env_ref`** (per-guard) and `n_decided_via_env_ref_shortcircuit` per executed
  operation (block 4); and block (6)'s whole-table set — the **top-10 `EnvRef` paths with counts**,
  `n_env_ref_guards`, `n_env_ref_nodes`, `n_zip`, `n_membership_cmp`, `n_var_self`,
  `n_opaque_only_by_var_self` and **`n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer`**. **Block (3)'s and block (4)'s
  fields are asserted to carry DIFFERENT names because they carry different units** (round 2, A-C8) —
  a reader cross-footing the two must be able to reconcile them from the JSON alone, and with one name
  in two units could not: `:2055` is one guard and two nodes. The two measurement fix-ups of
  §15.9 are asserted landed: the population is **544 / `pick_up_tips` 223** (fix-up (1), already landed
  as `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260907.json`, or the difference is published with a named cause),
  and no guard the tip or volume family claims carries a predicate reason. **The stub-defeating half is
  the top-10 path list together with `n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer`**: a count alone cannot show what
  the production absorbed, an implementation that widened `EnvRef` beyond §15.2 G7 is visible in the
  list and nowhere else, and an implementation that skipped G7's PLR-layer test reports a refusal count
  of 0 while the list fills with `self._is_error_tail`-class entries.
- **AC-15.4 (the operand observation, its fail-closed rule, and the counterfactual).** After O1,
  `resources_from_example`'s output carries a non-`None` `type` for **≥ 90%** of the resources
  referenced by the benchmark's planned kwargs, and a non-`None` `element_type` for every `Ref`
  carrying a `cell` **whose parent's element-class set is a singleton**; the pre-O1 baseline (`type`
  from `deck_layout` only, `element_type` universally `None`,
  `plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:397-410`) is published beside it. **The count of parents with
  heterogeneous children — for which `element_type` is `None` by the fail-closed rule of §15.4 — is
  published beside the coverage numbers**, and a fixture asserts that a parent with two distinct child
  classes yields `element_type is None` rather than first-element-wins. §15.9(5)'s with/without
  residual comparison differs on **≥ 1** operation. A zero difference fails this criterion — that is
  the stub-defeating half, since a change that threads the field but never reaches an atom would
  otherwise pass on the field counts alone.
- **AC-15.5 (evaluation: F ⇒ SAFE, ½ ⇒ the finest reason, and E-SCOPE).** Four fixtures. (i) A guard
  evaluating `F` yields exactly one `Verdict.SAFE` finding at `guard.site` with `category == ""` and
  `reason == ""` — and, per E-UNCOND(6), the guard's own `scope_trail[0]` self-entry is asserted **not**
  to be evaluated a second time as a scope entry. (ii) A guard whose enclosing scope entry evaluates
  `F` yields `SAFE` **regardless of its own predicate**, asserted with the guard's own predicate at
  `T` — the shape is now `transfer`'s
  (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:1333-1340`), **not** the withdrawn
  `:1185`/`:1188` one, and `:1335`/`:1337`/`:1340` are asserted `SAFE` by name under D1's
  `param_defaults`. (iii) A guard with an unresolvable kwarg yields `guard_operand_unknown`; with an
  unresolvable free name, `guard_env_dependent`. **Plus round 2's clause-ordering fixture (A-C5),
  landing with the rest of this criterion on T31: `self.backend.f(?0)` — an `EnvRef` whose one
  argument is a kwarg renamed to `?<j>` and
  therefore a ⊤ operand of this call — yields `guard_operand_unknown`, NOT `guard_env_dependent`**,
  which is the assertion that
  the amendment relaxed neither of the gate's two zero-conditions. (iv) One `Finding` per guard is
  preserved: an
  operation with `n` guards — **`k` of them tier (iii)** — yields exactly `n` findings, asserted as a
  count, and `join` is called once. (ii) is the stub-defeating half.
- **AC-15.6 (`WILL_FAIL` only when reachability is established, and the scope annotation).** A guard
  evaluating `T` at depth 0 with an empty `scope_trail` **in a `K` containing no earlier
  `Return`/`Try`/`Raise`/`Break`/`Continue`** yields `Verdict.WILL_FAIL` with
  `category == "precondition_state"`; the same guard yields `Verdict.UNKNOWN` with
  `reason == "guard_env_dependent"` under each of **eight** perturbations, one fixture apiece — a
  `while` header in the trail; a `for` header R1 did not bind; a trail entry parsing `Opaque`; a trail
  entry evaluating ½; a trail entry beginning `"else of: if "` whose test text is in `env` (which must
  **not** satisfy it, preserving increment 5's AC-14.4 behaviour); **the same guard at `depth == 1`
  with a `T` predicate** (E-UNCOND(4)); **`_check_no_lid`'s `:117`, asserted by name**, whose empty
  trail sits after the early `return` at
  `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:113-114` (E-UNCOND(5)); and a
  depth-0 empty-trail guard in a `K` containing an earlier `ast.Try`. Separately: **a tier-(iii) guard
  emits exactly one `Finding`, `Verdict.UNKNOWN`, `reason == "guard_env_dependent"`**, and contributes
  its `site` to `AnalysisReport.scope.excludes_sites`; tier (iii) is asserted to be selected by
  `guard.is_dynamic_raise` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:505-509`) and **not** by any site
  list or condition-text match; `join`'s input multiset **is** asserted to contain it; and
  `check_graph`'s two-positional-argument call form returns a report whose `schema_version` is still 1.
  The `else of:` case, the `:117` case and the depth-1 case are the stub-defeating halves.
- **AC-15.7 (the vocabulary and registry arithmetic is exactly as specified, under the user's 260907 answers).**
  `len(REASON_VOCABULARY) == 12` against HM-14's unchanged `declared == 12`
  (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:613-631`); the commit's parent has 10, so the diff is
  visibly 10 → 12; `len(live_rows()) == 24` and `BUDGET_CAP == 24`; **HM-25's `declared` is 9 and
  HM-24's is 3**, asserted directly, so a spend on the wrong row fails;
  `test_no_surface_exceeds_its_declared_size`, `test_total_declared_within_budget` and
  `test_reason_vocabulary_closed_forward` all pass, the last with both new members reachable from ≥ 1
  construction site. **No longer conditional: the user approved both §15.14 Q4 and Q5 on 260907**
  (`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:262-265`), so the assertions are
  `len(REASON_VOCABULARY) == 12` and HM-25 `declared == 9` **unconditionally** — the declined branches
  (11 members, `declared == 8`) are dead and a silent divergence in either direction fails.
  The 260907 amendment adds **no** vocabulary member and **no** registry row (§15.8), so this
  criterion's arithmetic is unchanged by it — which is itself asserted, as the amendment's cheapest
  falsification.
  **Plus round 2's registry concession (A-C6), asserted at T31 where the spend lands.** HM-25's `what`
  names `EnvRef`, `Zip` and the `in`/`not in` comparators, **and `_measure_hm25` imports the symbols
  that implement them**, so the entry's measure moves when its `what` does
  (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:300-351`). The measured pattern count for HM-25 is
  asserted `<= declared == 9`; **if the added symbols push it past 9, T31 STOPS and surfaces a further
  ceiling spend to the user rather than raising `declared` on its own authority** — the contingency is
  written here so it is a decision, not a discovery.
- **AC-15.8 (tier 1 — 0 unsound under the unmodified predicate, and the decided-findings floor).** The
  sidecar-gated replay reports `unsound == 0` under the **unmodified** predicate
  (`plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:645-647`, unchanged by this increment), `rows_setup_error == 0`,
  `rows_executed == 343`, crosscheck 191/191 at agreement 1.0, and `rows_excused_by_scope` published as
  an annotation with **no threshold**. The after-ledger is produced by the unmodified
  `plr-sema/eval/unknown_ledger.py` with `consistency.ok == true`, and the delta on
  `n_findings_by_reason` / `n_clusters` / `per_op_reason_set_histogram` is published.
  **The gated number is `n_findings_decided`** — findings whose emitted `verdict` is `Verdict.SAFE` or
  `Verdict.WILL_FAIL` — broken down **per PLR site**, with a floor of **≥ 223**. 223 is
  `pick_up_tips`'s own operation count from §15.9's candidate table, i.e. the minimum implied by one of
  its three tier-(i) guards clearing on every op; it is derived from this document's own prediction
  rather than asserted. `guard_env_dependent` and `guard_operand_unknown` counts are published
  **separately** and are explicitly **excluded** from "converted". The `guard_predicate_unparsed` delta
  is published with **no floor**, as the grammar's coverage measure only. **The stub-defeating half:
  an implementation that parses every condition and resolves nothing scores `n_findings_decided == 0`
  and fails** — which the draft's ≥ 1,000-converted floor would have passed (§15.10).
- **AC-15.9 (non-regression across tiers 2b and 3).** m1 199/199, m2 289/289, v1 67/67 at the raised
  index with 0 unsound, tier 2b at 16 fixtures with `region_unsound == 0` and
  `region_will_fail_fired >= 7` and `volume_will_fail_fired == 3`. Every number is re-measured against
  the sprint-123 close baseline and any movement is attributed before the run is accepted — the
  E-SCOPE rule is what could move tier 2b, by converting a previously-`UNKNOWN` guard to `SAFE` inside
  an executed region.
- **AC-15.10 (tier 3 — the predicate mutant fires at the raised index).**
  `plr-sema/eval/predicate_mutants.py` reports p1 with **0 unsound** in both directions and its
  achieved `WILL_FAIL`-at-the-raised-index count published against a floor of **≥ 1**, over all three
  mutators (duplicate `use_channels`, short `offsets`, non-`TipSpot` element), **published per
  mutator**. The duplicate-`use_channels` mutator is asserted to fire against an `assert`-kind guard
  specifically. **The non-`TipSpot` mutator is asserted to report `0 achieved` / `0 unsound`** under
  the restated E-TYPE's never-exact rule (§15.10), so a zero there passes and a `WILL_FAIL` there
  *fails* — an implementation that fabricated it would be the C4 false-positive mechanism reappearing.
- **AC-15.11 (this document is machine-checked).** `plr-sema/tests/test_spec_lint.py` gains
  `SPEC_INCREMENT_6` and parametrises it into both live-spec tests
  (`plr-sema/tests/test_spec_lint.py:212-255`); `.praxia/docs/INDEX.md` is regenerated; and
  `uv run pytest plr-sema/tests/test_spec_lint.py -q` is **actually run** with its result recorded —
  both the citation checker and the AC-gating half of the cross-reference checker reporting **zero**
  failing violations over this file, and the other six specs unchanged at zero.
- **AC-15.12 (tier (ii), conditional — only if the round overturns §15.6).** `env` gains
  `get_strictness`; the observation is returned from inside the executed window as increment 5's
  `volume_tracking_observed` is — **the producer is `run_runtime`'s return at
  `plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:370-373`**, not `run_static_calls`'s consumption of the already-
  returned flag at `:593-595`, which is what the draft cited (round 1, C18); `cache_key`'s fifth
  component partitions on it, with the default-`env` key asserted byte-identical to today's; and the
  backend-signature derivation publishes its complete measured selection. **If §15.6's recommendation
  stands, this criterion is withdrawn together with its task row rather than left unsatisfied.**

## 15.12 Task rows

> Ordering is forced by §15.9's gate: **T30 must land and publish its measured sets, and the GO/NO-GO
> must be recorded, before T31 constructs any `SAFE` or `WILL_FAIL`.** T30 landed and recorded
> **NO-GO** (§15.15); **T35 inherits the whole of that gate condition** — it is the amendment plus a
> re-measure, and T31 waits on *its* recorded GO, not on T30's. A T35 that landed the grammar without
> re-running the measurement would be the exact configuration this box exists to prevent, with the
> added hazard that the amendment moves a reason the gate reads. This is the same normative gate
> increment 5 §14.0 imposes for the same reason: a landed evaluator without a published coverage
> measurement can construct a definite verdict whose basis nobody has inspected.

> **Normative (why the amendment's row is `T35` and not `T30c` — round 2, A-C9).** The cross-reference
> lint's task-row pattern is
> `TASK_ROW_RE = re.compile(r"^\|\s*\*\*(T\d+|#\d+[a-z]?)\*\*[^|]*\|")`
> (`plr-sema/scripts/check_spec_crossrefs.py:58`), and the `[a-z]?` suffix sits on the `#\d+`
> alternative **only** — so `| **T30c** |` never matched, its gate cell was never scanned by the
> AC-gating half, and the amendment's obligations were formally hung off **T30**, a row §15.15 records
> as landed. The row is renamed **`T35`**, which the regex accepts, and **AC-15.1 and AC-15.3 move
> from T30's gate cell to T35's** — T35 ships the final grammar and writes the report the gate is read
> from, so it satisfies both criteria in full, while T30's contribution is a precondition rather than a
> gate. AC-15.5(iii)'s new clause-ordering fixture stays with AC-15.5 on **T31**, which is the row that
> owns the reason rule it asserts. **Every AC in this document is gated exactly once** — the lint's own
> `ac_multiply_gated` / `ac_ungated` checks (`plr-sema/scripts/check_spec_crossrefs.py:148-156`) are
> what enforce that, and they read the **gate cell** (column 4) only, so an AC named in a scope cell is
> documentation and not a gate. T33 re-runs the lint, which is what will catch a regression here.

**Sizing note, revised honestly after round 1.** T30 grew ~420 → **~530**: `param_defaults` is ~30 LOC
of new derivation (D1), O1 is ~40 rather than ~25 and is a *new* element walk rather than an extension
of `resource_types_from_kwargs` (C11a), the heterogeneous-parent rule is ~5 more, and blocks (2)'s two
new counts — D2's `channels_for_call` tally and the name-coincidence exposure — are ~35 together.
T31 grew ~450 → **~560**: three E-UNCOND clauses, three E-CALL clauses, the restated E-TYPE, the
derived tier-(iii) path, the nested-`Opaque` rule, and roughly a dozen new fixtures. T32 **shrank**
~380 → **~300**, because deleting the fence narrowing removes an entire comparison path and its
published count. **T30 at ~530 is past one session and splits cleanly** at the grammar (G0–G6, pure,
with its own fixtures) versus the idioms plus `param_defaults` plus O1 plus the measurement script.
**Do not split T30 from T31 across a sprint boundary in the other direction**: a landed T31 without
T30's published measurement is the configuration §15.9's gate exists to prevent.
**T35 is ~145** (was ~120 as T30c, before round 2): roughly 55 for the three productions plus
`contains_env_ref`, the `Var("self")` invariant and the JSON round-trip; **~25 for round 2's additions
— G7's PLR-layer index test and its fail-closed default, the α/β-substituted walk, and
`n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer`** (the `Zip`-resolution, comprehension-target and membership rules are
*negative* LOC on the derive side, since the deleted deciding branch was never written); ~10 for the
remaining family-dispatch fix-up, fix-up (1) having landed; ~40 for block (6) and the
per-cluster/per-op `n_env_ref_nodes`/`n_env_ref` fields; ~15 for round 2's five new fixtures. It does
**not** grow T31, which gains E-ENV as a short evaluation rule and the §15.7 reason rule as a
three-branch decision — the amendment's cost is concentrated in the derive side and in what gets
published, which is where its inspectability lives.

**One item this document deliberately does NOT budget: the delegate→caller argument map.** §15.4's
E-CALL(depth) forbids the resolution rather than building it. Building it — a `delegate_arg_binding`
map over both positional and keyword arguments, matched against the delegate's own `ast.arguments`,
fail-closed on `*args`/`**kwargs`/`Starred`/a delegate called more than once, using P9's shipped
singleton test (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/receiver_state.py:957-959`) — is **~90 LOC over a new
derived field with its own measured selection and its own registry argument**. It would land `:875`
and `:117`, and it belongs in increment 7 with the tier-(ii) work.

---

## 15.13 Not in this increment

- **Tier (ii), under §15.6's recommendation.** The backend signature (`liquid_handler.py:375`,
  `:383`), deck membership (`:321`), head channel count (`:409`), lid topology (`:116`/`:117`, and
  increment 4 §13.1's lid disposition stands), `can_pick_up_tip` (`:514`), and the well-seeding
  observation that would move `volume_state_unknown`.
- **A third binding idiom (γ), the bounded literal-display loop.** `for n, p in [("resources", resources), …]`
  (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:981-989`) is a `for` over an
  `ast.List` of `(str, Name)` tuples whose trip count and per-iteration binding are both syntactically
  evident, and it is the **only** thing standing between `aspirate`/`dispense` and a
  `{guard_env_dependent}`-only residual (§15.9). **Round 1 disposed it: NOT adopted, deferred to
  increment 7, to be revisited alongside the `pred`-aware `BRANCH`** (§15.14 Q3). It is a *loop*
  recognition rule and therefore lands in increment 5 §14.6 R1's territory; this round already
  conceded eight blocking items, and D1's `param_defaults` restores `transfer`'s three guards at
  strictly lower risk. Adopting γ would grow T30 by roughly 60 further lines on top of the ~530 it
  already carries.
- **A fourth idiom for loop-append bindings** (`tips = []` then `tips.append(...)`,
  `external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:653-658`) and for
  `n = len(<param>)` (`:819`). Both are real, both are needed by `drop_tips`/`discard_tips`, and both
  are a general dataflow pass by another name.
- **Four productions the 260907 amendment CONSIDERED and did NOT adopt, named individually because
  each would have flipped a further method's residual and that is precisely why they are refused.**
  *(A fifth, withdrawn in round 2 after the amendment had already granted it, follows this group.)*
  The amendment's mandate was the two `self`-rooted blockers on the gate candidate; adopting a
  production *because* it moves some other method's residual is the anti-gaming failure §15.9's box
  exists to prevent, and each of these is a real production with its own soundness argument to make in
  its own increment.
  - **A general `Identity(Term, Term)` for `x is y`.** `:116`'s `lidded is resource`
    (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:116`) is the single blocker
    keeping `aspirate` (77 ops), `dispense` (40), `transfer` (19) and `stamp` (27) — 163 operations,
    30% of the benchmark — from `{decidable, guard_env_dependent}`. `Is` deliberately admits only the
    constant `None` on its right
    (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/predicate_ast.py:251-259`). Generalising it is ~15 LOC and would
    make four more methods GO candidates, which is exactly the reason to refuse it here: it is not an
    environment-read recognition, it decides object identity — a relation the IR models nowhere — and
    it belongs with increment 7's lid topology, which is what `:116` actually needs.
  - **Tuple-display comparison** (`:2030`'s
    `(source.num_items_x, source.num_items_y) == (target.num_items_x, target.num_items_y)`) — a
    `Term` for `ast.Tuple` displays, elementwise `Cmp`. Increment 7.
  - **Arithmetic `BinOp` terms** — `:2211`'s modulo, and the subtraction at `volume_tracker.py`'s
    `:91`. This is
    Open decision 2's territory (G5) and the volume family's; unchanged.
  - **`EnvRef` path lookup against an observation.** Forbidden outright by §15.4 E-ENV in this
    increment; it *is* increment 7's tier (ii) and T34's row.
- **A FIFTH refused production, withdrawn in round 2 after the amendment had already granted it: the
  membership DECIDING case (A-C2/A-C10).** spec_version 18's G8(2) let a membership `Cmp` evaluate
  `T`/`F` when its right operand resolved to a concrete `Seq` of hashable `Lit`s and its left to a
  `Lit`. **That branch is deleted; every `in`/`not in` `Cmp` is ½ unconditionally this increment**
  (§15.4 E-ENV). Three independent reasons, each sufficient: **(a) nothing can reach it** — there is no
  `ast.List`/`ast.Tuple` display production in `Term` (`_parse_term`,
  `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/predicate_ast.py:518-539`), and this amendment adds none, so a literal
  container RHS is `Opaque` and only a `Var` resolving to an `ir.Seq` from `call.kwargs` remains;
  **(b) its measured population at this pin is zero**, with no fixture and no published counter — it
  would have shipped an evaluator branch capable of emitting a definite verdict that nothing exercises;
  and **(c) soundness** — deciding `not in` ⇒ `T` requires the `Seq` to be **complete** rather than a
  lower bound, and §15.4 asserts that of an `ir.Seq` nowhere. Deleting it is also what makes §15.4's
  *"the amendment decides nothing"* a theorem rather than a prediction, which is the property §15.9's
  anti-gaming box needs and could not otherwise have.
  **Reopening condition, stated so this is a deferral and not a taboo:** the branch may be re-adopted
  in the increment that (i) adds a literal-container `Term` production, (ii) states normatively whether
  an `ir.Seq` is complete or a lower bound, and (iii) publishes a measured population plus a
  per-decision counter beside `n_decided_via_env_ref_shortcircuit`. Absent all three it stays refused.
- **Numeric `Cmp` outside the volume bridge.** Open decision 2's resolution stands unchanged (G5).
- **A `pred`-aware `BRANCH`** (increment 3 §12.3.6 B2). The same evaluator serves it and it is the
  natural increment 7 alongside tier (ii).
- **Replacing §8's hand-written-contract bridge.** The main spec's boundary row says (c) replaces the
  string-mention bridge "wholesale"
  (`.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:2534`) and adds "must be replaced *before*
  §8 is ever made gating". §8 is **not** gating (AC-8.3), so the replacement is deferred, and this
  document records the debt rather than discharging it: the grammar this increment ships is the
  machinery §8.1's `requires_tips` comparison needs
  (`.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:2111-2117`), and rewiring §8 onto it is a
  separate task with its own disagreement-rate measurement.
- **The delegate→caller argument map**, forbidden by §15.4's E-CALL(depth) and sized at ~90 LOC in
  §15.12's sizing note. Increment 7, with tier (ii).
- **A site-keyed soundness-fence narrowing.** The ~3-line `traceback.extract_tb(...)[-1]` capture at
  `training/verify/verifier.py:143` that would let the fence distinguish a backend re-raise from a
  PLR-layer raise is increment 7's, where a joined `SAFE` first becomes possible (§15.5).
- **Precision targets.** Deferred row (f) stands
  (`.praxia/docs/specs/260901_plr-sema-pre-corpus-spec.md:2524`). AC-15.8's floor of ≥ 223 decided
  findings is a *floor against a null result*, not a target — and it replaces the draft's ≥ 1,000
  converted findings, which round 1 showed was met by the reason rename alone (§15.10).
- **#4923 / #4924** — decision hooks only, per the plan's §3.5–3.6. **#4956** is the Coxswain track.

## 15.14 The eight questions, and their dispositions

**All seven are now closed. Four were disposed by argument or measurement in round 1; the three that
were the user's — Q4, Q5 and Q7 — were answered on 260907, together with Q3's confirmation and one new
question the measurement raised (Q8, the amendment)
(`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:262-265`). Nothing in this section is
pending.**

1. **Q1 — is the coupling in §15.5 real, and does the sprint's headline move? DISPOSED: the coupling
   holds; the substitution was APPROVED BY THE USER 260907 (Q7).** The stated refutation criterion
   was *"name one executed operation whose non-(iii) residual is empty."* The re-run ledger answers it
   by measurement: `_check_args`'s two tier-(ii) guards carry `n_ops_blocked` 544 with `per_method`
   summing to 544 (§15.0), so **no such operation exists**. The challenger's proposed refutation — 12
   unaccounted operations — was arithmetic: they are duplicate `move_*` occurrences the pre-fix
   `(row_id, op_id)` set keying folded away, now published in `collision_ops`. The coupling is
   additionally now structural via tier (iii) ⇒ `UNKNOWN`.
2. **Q2 — does §15.6's evidence close tier (ii)? DISPOSED: DEFER stands, with a corrected reason.**
   `strictness == Strictness.STRICT` is gated behind `len(extra) > 0` in its own enclosing scope
   (`external/pylabrobot/pylabrobot/liquid_handling/liquid_handler.py:380-383`), so the one cheap `env`
   member converts no guard — round 1 conceded this half outright. It also showed the draft's *cost*
   argument was wrong: on the frozen benchmark the backend is one named literal class, not a surface.
   **The corrected disposition is "deferred because the general derivation is a new class surface with
   its own measured selection, and because the increment already carries more soundness risk than it
   can absorb"** — not "because the specific case is expensive" (§15.6).
3. **Q3 — does γ (§15.13) belong in this increment? DISPOSED: no — and CONFIRMED by the user 260907
   (decision 3, "γ not adopted"). Deferred to increment 7, to be
   revisited alongside the `pred`-aware `BRANCH`.** Without it `aspirate` and `dispense` — 117 of 544
   operations — keep a `guard_predicate_unparsed` residual and the gate rests on `pick_up_tips` alone,
   which is a real cost and is stated as one. Against it: γ is a loop-recognition rule in increment 5
   R1's territory, this round already conceded eight blocking items, and D1's `param_defaults`
   restores `transfer`'s three guards at lower risk.
4. **Q4 — two new reasons, or one? APPROVED BY THE USER 260907: two.** Shipping both exhausts
   HM-14 at 12 of 12 (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/verdict.py:133-168`). §15.7's mechanical
   distinguishability test — *did every free name resolve?* — survived round 1, and item 3's widening
   of `guard_env_dependent` to cover unestablished reachability makes that member carry strictly more
   traffic than the draft anticipated. **The one-member fallback is described in §15.7 and costs the
   distinction that scopes increment 7 plus one of the GO gate's two zero-conditions.**
5. **Q5 — is §15.8's "neither HM-24 nor HM-25" position sound? DISPOSED: no. HM-25 `declared` 8 → 9,
   APPROVED BY THE USER 260907.** The position rested on reason 1, and round 1 broke
   reason 1 two ways (the unconstrained iterand, and the unspecified delegate→caller substitution).
   Both are repaired by new normative clauses in this revision, which is not the same as reason 1
   having held. The correct row is **HM-25**, not HM-24 — loud, exact-count-gated, same idiom family
   as the P3a entry already on it (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/_hand_maintained.py:899-906`). `live_rows()`
   stays 24; no row is added and no cap conversation opens.
6. **Q6 — does §15.5's `excludes_sites` weaken the fence more than it appears? DISPOSED: yes, and the
   narrowing is deleted.** The requested construction exists and is easy: any `TypeError` row. There
   is no `exc_class → site` mapping that could be total or injective — the shipped taxonomy covers 132
   PLR-defined classes and none of the builtins the benchmark raises
   (`training/verify/data/plr_exception_taxonomy.json:1-29`), the runtime side captures no traceback,
   and `TypeError` is raised at four PLR precondition sites *and* re-raised at `:576`. The narrowing
   also purchased nothing, because §15.5 proves no joined `SAFE` is reachable for it to protect. The
   fence is now the unmodified `plr-sema/eval/oracle_common.py:645-647` and
   `rows_excused_by_scope` is a pure annotation.
7. **Q7 (raised by round 1) — the headline substitution itself. APPROVED BY THE USER 260907:
   substituted.** Formally distinct from Q1, which is the technical claim; Q7 is what the sprint may
   say it delivered. The sprint's deliverable is per-finding `SAFE`, a `WILL_FAIL` on a decidable and
   reachable violation, and a residual that names the missing observation per guard; **the first
   joined `SAFE` on a real operation is increment 7's.** See §15.5's decision box.
8. **Q8 (raised by the T30 measurement, not by round 1) — the NO-GO: accept it, or amend the grammar?
   APPROVED BY THE USER 260907: amend, narrowly, as spec_version 18, with a short adversarial pass.**
   The two blockers on the only GO candidate are `self`-rooted environment reads the grammar had no
   production for, so the residual was being charged to `guard_predicate_unparsed` — "the grammar
   failed here" — when the true residual is a missing observation. The amendment is §15.2 G7/G8,
   §15.4 E-ENV and §15.7's reason rule; its anti-gaming argument is §15.9's box; its registry
   disposition is §15.8's; and its own falsification set is §15.9's re-prediction table plus block
   (6). **What was NOT approved and is not taken here**: any production that would flip a *second*
   method's residual (§15.13's four, now five), any environment *read* (§15.4 E-ENV), and any further
   ceiling or vocabulary spend (§15.8).
   **The short adversarial pass RAN on 260907** and its thirteen objections are dispositioned in
   §15.16.2. It returned `needs_revision` as a revise-and-advance, left the GO prediction intact, and
   made the amendment strictly narrower: G7 shape (2) gained a PLR-layer refusal test, the membership
   deciding case was deleted, `Zip` resolution was pinned, and §15.8's registry position was conceded
   to the fallback. **One item it surfaced is owed back to the user at sprint close** — the
   `in`/`not in` widening was not one of the two productions decision 5 named (A-C7).

## 15.15 Implementation record

*(Empty until band B lands. Column shape mirrors increment 5 §14.17.)*

| row | commit | what landed | measured vs the spec's expectation | divergences |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T30 | `58e5c3fc` (T30a), `7c0fe59a` (T30b-1), `6cbbe442` (T30b-2) | Typed mini-AST + total `parse`; `InlinedGuard.predicate` (`condition` retained); `param_defaults`; α/β bindings with the iterand single-write and β-preserving rebinding; O1 element types (default-off); `t30_measure.py` with the five blocks and the reason-based gate | Parse: 7,528 guards, 6,295 non-`Opaque`, 1,233 `Opaque`, 925 nested-`Opaque`. Bindings: α **5** (predicted ≥ 3), β **11** (predicted 8 — extras at transfer line 1353 and two in VantageBackend). `param_defaults`: transfer's target_vols/ratios/source_vol and pick_up_tips' offsets/use_channels all `null`, as D1 requires. Heterogeneous parents: **0**. D2: `channels_for_call` non-`None` on **every** executed pick_up_tips op (floor met); tip_spots lowers as `ir.Seq` on all. Name-coincidence exposure: 936 depth≥1 occurrences. O1 delta: 389 ops differ; with O1 `guard_operand_unknown` is **0** everywhere (§15.4's O1 claim holds). **GATE: NO-GO** — no executed op reaches zero `guard_predicate_unparsed`; pick_up_tips' residual is {decidable, guard_env_dependent, guard_predicate_unparsed}, the last carried by two guards: line 409 (α binds invalid_channels but the filter `c not in self.head` is `Opaque` ⇒ §15.7's nested-`Opaque` rule) and line 514 (`zip(...)` is not a G1 `Term` ⇒ `Opaque`). Per §15.9: derive code kept, T31 not started, decision to the user | (1) §15.9's prediction table called line 409 `guard_env_dependent`; §15.7's nested-`Opaque` rule, whose worked example is that very site, assigns `guard_predicate_unparsed` — an internal §15.7/§15.9 inconsistency the measurement exposed. Both blockers are expressions rooted at `self.` (head, backend): tier (ii) by §15.1's definition, but the grammar has no production that recognises an environment read as such. Proposed amendment for the user (spec_version 18): an `EnvRef` leaf (expression rooted at `self.`, optionally called with `Term` args) that evaluates ½ and carries `guard_env_dependent`, plus `zip(Term, Term)` as a `Term`. **APPROVED by the user 260907 and now normative as §15.2 G7/G8, §15.4 E-ENV and §15.7's reason rule; T35 (renamed from T30c in round 2, A-C9) re-measures.** (2) `t30_measure.py` re-implemented `run_row`'s gating and counted 923 ops (pick_up_tips 361) against the ledger's 544 (223); per-site classification is population-independent so the verdict stands. **FIXED in `15b84d31`**: the population is now sourced from `oracle_replay.main()` itself and re-measured at 544 / 223 into `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260907.json`; named cause = `row_to_verifier_inputs` called without the sidecar's `ambiguity_class`, which sets `skip_reason` there. (3) The measured report is `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json` (the text above said 260904). |

## 15.16 Round-1 disposition

**Round 1 was `praxia:spec-challenger` (C1–C18) against `praxia:spec-defender` (adjudications plus
three defender-identified gaps D1–D3), both at Opus, both against spec_version 16 at commit
`6407d92a`. Verdict on both sides: `needs_revision`.** This table records what each objection did to
the text. "Adopted" means the remedy is now normative here; "adopted (defender's form)" means the
challenger's diagnosis was accepted and his proposed remedy was replaced; "rebutted" means the text
did not change on the merits.

| id | disposition | what changed in the text | § touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** | adopted, magnitude corrected | E-UNCOND(5): a depth-0 empty `scope_trail` is not vacuously unconditional unless `K` has no earlier `Return`/`Try`/`Raise`/`Break`/`Continue`. The shipped `volume_guard_is_unconditional` precedent is named as implementing the *wrong* reading. Population is `:117` (163 ops) + `:2092` (93), not the filed ~268: `:1770`/`:1920` have three-deep `"else of: if …"` trails and were already blocked | §15.2 G0, §15.4 E-UNCOND(5), §15.1.4, AC-15.6 |
| **C2** | conceded in full | `InlinedGuard` has no `caller_scope`; E-SCOPE's bridged-guard clause is deleted. Remedy is the forbiddance, not the field: **E-UNCOND(4)**, no `WILL_FAIL` at `depth >= 1` | §15.4 E-SCOPE, E-UNCOND(4), AC-15.6 |
| **C3** | adopted (drop the narrowing); "no taxonomy exists" rebutted | The fence narrowing is **deleted**; the predicate stays `oracle_common.py:645-647` unmodified and `rows_excused_by_scope` becomes a pure annotation. A taxonomy does exist but covers 132 PLR-defined classes and none of the builtins or re-raise sites, and cannot be injective | §15.5, §15.10, AC-15.8, §15.14 Q6 |
| **C4** | conceded in full | E-TYPE restated: `T` iff is-or-subclass-of, `F` iff hierarchy-disjoint **and** exact, ½ otherwise; a `_generic_plr_type_name` declaration is normatively never exact, so the `F` branch is unreachable on the benchmark. Kills a live false `WILL_FAIL` on 65 `drop_tips`/`discard_tips` ops and restores the `:875` type reasoning | §15.4 E-TYPE, §15.1.2, AC-15.1 |
| **C5** | conceded | The ≥ 1,000-converted floor is replaced by **`n_findings_decided ≥ 223`**, per PLR site, with `guard_env_dependent`/`guard_operand_unknown` published separately and excluded; the `guard_predicate_unparsed` delta keeps no floor | AC-15.8, §15.10, §15.13 |
| **C6** | consequence 1 rebutted with a narrower clause; 2 and 3 conceded | **β-preserving rebinding** clause (a single length-preserving `ast.ListComp` over `x` itself) keeps β's population at **eight**, published as a measurement. The `:1185`/`:1188` "cleanest result" paragraph is **deleted**, and §15.9's `dispense` row corrected. The challenger's own suggested narrowing is recorded as dead (it saves none of the six) | §15.3, §15.1.3, §15.9, AC-15.2 |
| **C7** | (a) conceded; (b) literal conceded, collision rebutted | **E-CALL(5)**: a `Var` naming a parameter written below the guard resolves to ⊤. The P3a hook is restated over the receiver's **derived** `channel_kwarg`/`channel_default_param`, never the forbidden literal `"use_channels"`. No ordering collision exists: `channels_for_call` already resolves the kwarg first | §15.3 β, §15.4 E-CALL(5), AC-15.2 |
| **C8** | site-list horn rebutted; tautology conceded, and his remedy rejected | Tier (iii) is **derived** from `guard.is_dynamic_raise` (seven `raise <name>` sites at this pin), zero registry cost. His proposed derived (i)/(ii) tiering is rejected as **self-satisfying**; the GO gate is restated over **reasons**. `:117` retiered, `:2092` added to the `move_*` enumeration | §15.1 (new box), §15.1.3, §15.1.4, §15.9 |
| **C9** | contradiction conceded; his remedy rejected as unsound | Tier (iii) emits **one `Finding`, `UNKNOWN`, `guard_env_dependent`** plus an `excludes_sites` entry. Emitting `SAFE` would let `join` claim the backend did not raise — A-COMPLETES on the current operation. `guard_env_dependent`'s definition widened by one clause for unestablished reachability | §15.5, §15.7, AC-15.5(iv), AC-15.6 |
| **C10** | conceded, all four parts | `SoundnessScope` has exactly one field, `excludes_sites: tuple[PlrSite, ...]`; the `excludes`/`harness_internal` sentence is deleted; the type is stated as **new in this increment**; the two non-definitional citations are replaced by a motivation reference | §15.5 |
| **C11** | (a) fact conceded / sizing rebutted; (b) conceded; (c) conceded as disclosure | O1 restated as a **new element walk** (~40 LOC, not ~25 "over data the harness already computes"); **heterogeneous-parent singleton rule** with `element_type = None` fail-closed and a published count; the tier-(ii)-dependence of the GO is stated plainly in this document's own words | §15.4 O1, §15.9, AC-15.4 |
| **C12** | **REBUTTED on the merits, but the instrument was fixed anyway** | The 93/81 and 544/532 gaps were `(row_id, op_id)` set dedup under content-digest collisions, not unaccounted operations. Item 17 re-keyed the ledger positionally (`ca756bce`); every field now closes at 544/93, `consistency.ok` is `true`, and the 12 collisions are published and are all `move_*`. §15.0's note 2 wording corrected | §15.0 (notes 1–2 + new correction box) |
| **C13** | (1) conceded with a clause; (2) conceded outright; registry **HM-25, not HM-24** | The single-write requirement now ranges over **the iterand** as well as `x`. The delegate→caller substitution is forbidden (E-CALL(depth)) rather than assumed. §15.8's "neither row" position is withdrawn: **HM-25 8 → 9**, approved by the user 260907 | §15.3, §15.4 E-CALL(depth), §15.8, AC-15.7, §15.14 Q5 |
| **C14** | (a) rebutted (and exposes D1); (b) conceded | β is **not** dead: E-CALL step (2) had no data source at all, so resolution fell through to the β binding. **E-CALL(β)** models truthiness in four cases, with `Lit(None)` routed to β rather than to ⊤. `:522` survives C6 and C14 together, so the gate keeps a GO candidate | §15.4 E-CALL(β), §15.9, AC-15.2 |
| **C15** | conceded | **Nested-`Opaque` rule**: a predicate containing any `Opaque` node is `Opaque` for reason assignment, still Kleene-evaluated. Restores §15.7's legibility claim; `:409`'s 384 findings keep `guard_predicate_unparsed` | §15.2 G1, §15.7 |
| **C16** | conceded, textual | The contract-table regeneration moves `contracts_sha`, so the whole cache is **cold after T30 by design**; `env` is untouched, which is the property that matters. T30's gate adds a check that no test pins a literal key | §15.8, §15.12 T30 |
| **C17** | wording conceded; disposition unchanged | Q2's cost argument corrected — the draft priced the general case and charged the specific one for it. DEFER stands on soundness-risk grounds. The `:377-378` early-return fact is recorded as reinforcing E-UNCOND(5) | §15.6, §15.14 Q2 |
| **C18** | conceded, both defects | AC-15.12's producer citation corrected to `oracle_common.py:370-373`; §15.5's two non-definitional `SoundnessScope` citations dropped; §15.0's note-2 "distinct pairs" wording corrected | AC-15.12, §15.5, §15.0 |
| **D1** | adopted (defender-identified **blocker**) | E-CALL step (2)'s "recorded default" did not exist. T30 derives **`param_defaults`** from `ast.arguments.defaults`/`kw_defaults` restricted to `ast.Constant`, fail-closed (~30 LOC). Restores `transfer`'s `:1335`/`:1337`/`:1340` and gives E-CALL(β) case (3) a data source | §15.4 E-CALL(2), §15.1.3, §15.12 T30, AC-15.5 |
| **D2** | adopted (must-measure) | T30 block (2) publishes the count of executed `pick_up_tips` ops for which `channels_for_call` returns non-`None`, floor `== 223`. Without it a `:502` failure would be misattributed to O1 | §15.9(2), §15.12 T30/T32 |
| **D3** | adopted (minor) | **E-UNCOND(6)**: the `raise_guard`'s own condition sits at `scope_trail[0]` and is excluded from both scope tests, which range over `scope_trail[1:]` | §15.4 E-SCOPE, E-UNCOND(6), AC-15.5(i) |

**Items that landed outside this document.** Item 0 (routing the two user decisions) is the
orchestrator's. Item 17 (the ledger `row_id` fix and re-run) landed as `ca756bce`; its results are
folded into §15.0. Item 18's lint execution is T33's, and is the one AC in this document that no one in
round 1 could execute.

### 15.16.1 Amendment record — spec_version 17 → 18 (260907)

**Source: the T30 measurement, not an adversarial round.** Band B landed T30a/T30b, the reason-based
gate measured **NO-GO** (§15.15), and the user approved a narrow grammar amendment plus the four
outstanding decisions (§15.14 Q3–Q8). This table records what the measurement showed and what changed
in the text. A1–A6 were written to be attacked individually, and **they were**: the amendment's short
adversarial pass ran on 260907 and its thirteen objections are dispositioned in §15.16.2, which is why
`status` is now `reviewed-round-2`.

| id | what the measurement showed | what changed in the text | § touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** | **An internal inconsistency this document shipped in spec_version 17.** §15.9's prediction table said `liquid_handler.py:409` would carry `guard_env_dependent`; §15.7's nested-`Opaque` rule — whose *own* worked example is that site — said `guard_predicate_unparsed`. The measurement reported the latter (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:473-482`), correctly, because that is what the normative text said, and the gate turned on the difference. **The inconsistency existed and was not caught by round 1** | §15.7 gains a normative `EnvRef` reason rule that makes the two agree **by rule**: `contains_opaque` first (unchanged), then `contains_env_ref` ⇒ `guard_env_dependent`. The nested-`Opaque` rule is untouched; what changed is that the filter at `:409` no longer contains an `Opaque` node | §15.7, §15.9 |
| **A2** | Both of `pick_up_tips`'s residual blockers are expressions **rooted at the literal name `self`** — the receiver's head and backend, tier (ii) by §15.1's own definition — that the grammar could not recognise as environment reads and therefore charged to the reason meaning "the grammar failed" | **G7, `EnvRef(path, args)`**: two enumerated shapes, admissible in predicate and term position, with a closed negative list and the `Var("self")` invariant; **E-ENV**: ½/⊤ unconditionally, no environment read, no path table; §15.8's registry argument and its fallback; §15.9's anti-gaming box and block (6). **Round 2 narrowed shape (2) (A-C1)** with the PLR-layer index test — a `self.<name>(…)` naming an indexed method of the receiver class stays `Opaque` — and **withdrew §15.8's reason 1 and adopted the fallback (A-C6)**: the productions are named inside the HM-25 entry and `_measure_hm25` must import them | §15.2, §15.4, §15.7, §15.8, §15.9, §15.11, §15.12 |
| **A3** | `:514`'s condition is `not all(<expr> for channel, tip in zip(use_channels, tips))`; `zip(...)` is not a G1 `Term`, so the whole guard was `Opaque` **even though its body would have parsed** once `EnvRef` existed | **G8**: `Zip(items)` as a `Term` admissible **only** as an `AllOf`/`AnyOf` `seq`, with a positional tuple-target arity check; and `_CMP_OPS` widened by `in`/`not in` only. Explicitly recorded: `Zip` does **not** reopen §15.3's β exclusions, because α/β test the `ast.Assign` shape and still require a bare-`ast.Name` iterand. **AMENDMENT-SCOPE ITEM (round 2, A-C7):** decision 5 as put to the user named **two** productions — the `EnvRef` leaf and `zip(<Term>, <Term>)` (`.praxia/docs/plans/260904_plr-sema-sprint127-predicates.md:252-260`) — and **not** the `in`/`not in` widening of `_CMP_OPS`. It is taken **in scope of decision 5 by necessity**, on one stated ground: it is the comparator that makes `:409`'s filter `c not in self.head` readable at all, and without it `:409` stays `Opaque` and `pick_up_tips` stays NO-GO, i.e. it is load-bearing for the gate. **To be confirmed with the user at sprint close**; the header box's "nothing is pending" is softened accordingly. **Round 2 also narrowed this row's semantics**: `Zip` resolution is now normative (⊤ unless every item is a concrete `Seq`; quantification over a ⊤ seq is ½, never vacuously `T`), comprehension-bound targets are ⊤, and the membership **deciding** case is deleted outright (§15.13) | §15.2, §15.4, §15.11, §15.13 |
| **A4** | **The population caveat.** `t30_measure.py` re-implements `run_row`'s gating (`plr-sema/eval/t30_measure.py:19-37`) and counts 923 operations against the ledger's 544. The per-site classification is population-independent, so the NO-GO stands; every ratio and per-op count is not | §15.9 gains a normative fix-up box. **LANDED as `15b84d31`, before T35**: the population is sourced from `oracle_replay.main()` itself (`collect_executed_population`, `plr-sema/eval/t30_measure.py:19-38`) and re-measured at 544 / `pick_up_tips` 223 into `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260907.json`, with the named cause recorded (the sidecar's `ambiguity_class` was not passed to `row_to_verifier_inputs`). **The amendment's delta is therefore taken against that report, not against `t30_measured_260905.json`.** AC-15.3 asserts it | §15.9, §15.11, §15.12 |
| **A5** | **A family-dispatch violation in the measurement, not in the analyzer.** Blocks (3)/(4) assigned a predicate reason to `volume_tracker.py:92` and `:105` — `guard_predicate_unparsed` — where the ledger's own reason is `volume_state_unknown` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:733-742`) — §15.2's dispatch rule says the predicate evaluator never sees them. This mis-attributed `aspirate`/`dispense`'s blocker set | The same fix-up box: **T35** skips family-claimed guards and reports the family's own reason. §15.2 G7 additionally records that the dispatch rule, not the grammar, is what keeps family ownership stable — `EnvRef` is receiver-agnostic and `self.get_used_volume()` would otherwise match its shape (round 2 adds a **third** independent mechanism: G7's PLR-layer test refuses it, since `get_used_volume` is an indexed method of its own receiver class) | §15.2, §15.9 |
| **A6** | **`Var("self")` was being treated as a resolvable parameter.** `self` is a parameter of every PLR method, so the shipped classifier's *"is this name a parameter of `K`?"* test (`plr-sema/eval/t30_measure.py:914-926`) accepted it: `self.<x>` guards were reported `decidable_or_operand_dependent` (e.g. `:1185`, `outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:803-812`), and block (2)'s name-coincidence exposure list contains entries whose exposed name is literally `self` (`outputs/plr-sema/t30_measured_260905.json:86-103`) | The `Var("self")` invariant (§15.2 G7): after the amendment no parsed predicate may contain `Var("self")`, fail-closed, asserted as `n_var_self == 0` over the whole contract table (AC-15.1) with `n_opaque_only_by_var_self` published. §15.9 predicts `name_coincidence_exposure_count` **falls** for this reason and requires the fall to be attributed to it | §15.2, §15.9, §15.11 |

**What this amendment deliberately did not do, recorded here because each was available and would have
moved a published number.** It adopted no production that flips a second method's residual (§15.13's
four — five after round 2 withdrew the membership deciding case — of which a general `x is y` would
alone have made `aspirate`/`dispense`/`transfer`/`stamp` — 163
operations — GO candidates); it read no environment; it spent no registry row, no per-row ceiling and
no vocabulary slot; and it edited neither §15.3's idioms nor §15.9's gate condition, which is still
zero `guard_predicate_unparsed` and zero `guard_operand_unknown` on ≥ 1 executed operation.

### 15.16.2 Amendment-pass disposition — spec_version 18 → 19 (260907)

**Source: `praxia:spec-challenger` (Opus) scoped to the amendment delta only, against spec_version 18
at commit `f441d27e`; report persisted at
`.praxia/docs/audits/260907_plr-sema-predicate-amendment-challenger.md`.** Thirteen objections — three
blockers, five must-fix, three should-fix, two notes — verdict **`needs_revision`**, explicitly framed
as **revise-and-advance**. The pass answered its own three questions on the record: **no objection
changes the GO prediction for `pick_up_tips`**; the amendment is **not** gaming the gate; but its
**anti-gaming argument was unsound as written** (sentence 1 measurably false, sentence 2 incomplete,
silent on the gate's second zero-condition). Every objection below is **adopted**; none was rebutted.

| id | class | disposition | what changed in the text | § touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A-C1** | blocker | adopted — remedy (a), **derived**, plus (b)'s published split | G7 shape (2) admits a `self`-rooted call **only** when `len(path) >= 3` (a read *through* a receiver attribute) **or** its length-2 name is **absent from the derive package's own PLR function index** for the receiver class (`build_plr_function_index`, `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/receiver_state.py:1275-1308`) — a derived test, **no list**. PLR-layer helper calls (`self._is_error_tail`, `self._check_96_head_fits_in_container`, `self._find_available_sites_sorted`) stay `Opaque`, which is the coverage gap `guard_predicate_unparsed` means. `n_env_ref_refused_plr_layer` is published. The *"syntactically narrow … no arbitrary text"* sentence is **withdrawn** and replaced by the measured formulation (210 `self.`-rooted call conditions, 41 of them one shape, plus the refusal count). Fail-closed when no `function_index` is supplied. **The `stamp` row's `:1778`/`:1940` no longer flip** | §15.2 G7, §15.7, §15.9 (box + block 6 + table), §15.11, §15.12 T35, §15.16.1 A2 |
| **A-C2** | blocker | adopted — both uncounted paths closed **by rule**, not counted | With the `Zip`-resolution clause and the deleted membership deciding case, *"the amendment decides nothing"* becomes a **theorem**: the only path to a definite value is Kleene short-circuit over an already-decidable conjunct, published as `n_decided_via_env_ref_shortcircuit` (predicted 0). No `n_decided_via_zip_vacuous` / `n_decided_via_membership` counters are added, deliberately — a counter for a path the semantics forbids would be theatre | §15.4 E-ENV, §15.9 box + block (4) |
| **A-C3** | blocker | adopted verbatim | **Normative:** a `Zip` resolves to ⊤ unless **every** item resolves to a concrete `Seq`, then to the positional zip truncated to the shortest; `AllOf`/`AnyOf` over a ⊤ seq is ½, **never vacuously `T`**. The asymmetry at `:514` is stated (`use_channels` exact via `channels_for_call`; `tips` ⊤ because `[tip_spot.get_tip() for tip_spot in tip_spots]` is a *projecting* comprehension `_parse_filtered` rejects). AC-15.1 fixture (b): `AllOf(Zip(Seq([]), ⊤), <½>)` ⇒ **½** | §15.2 G8(1), §15.4 E-ENV, §15.11 AC-15.1 |
| **A-C4** | must-fix | adopted | **Normative:** both `contains_opaque` and `contains_env_ref` range over the **α/β-substituted** predicate — built by the new general helper `bindings.substitute` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/bindings.py:214-230`), which `t30_measure.py`'s classifier now calls explicitly (`plr-sema/eval/t30_measure.py:821-822`; re-anchored, T35 — the pre-T35 shipped classifier's own ad hoc one-level substitution, formerly named `_effective_unparsed`, is retired in favour of it), and which nothing normative said before this pass. AC-15.1 fixture (c) asserts `contains_env_ref` true for the substituted `:409` guard and false for its raw `predicate`. §15.7 additionally records the *second, independent* route by which `:409` reaches `guard_env_dependent`, so the GO survives even if this clause were dropped | §15.2 G7, §15.7, §15.11 AC-15.1 |
| **A-C5** | must-fix | adopted — reordered | §15.7's clauses are now (1) `contains_opaque`, (2) **the operand test** ⇒ `guard_operand_unknown`, (3) `contains_env_ref` ⇒ `guard_env_dependent`, (4) the residual rules. The gate has **two** zero-conditions and the amendment relaxes neither; §15.9's box now says so. AC-15.5(iii) gains a fixture: `self.backend.f(?0)` ⇒ `guard_operand_unknown` | §15.7, §15.9 box, §15.11 AC-15.5 |
| **A-C6** | must-fix | **conceded** | §15.8 reason 1 is **withdrawn** (HM-25's own `what` already books P8's zip-comprehension shape and P3a's `self.<x>` recognition). The stated fallback is now the disposition: `EnvRef`/`Zip`/`in` are named **inside** the α+β HM-25 entry (`declared` stays 8 → 9, approved), **and `_measure_hm25` must import the production symbols** so the entry's measure tracks its `what`. Contingency stated: a measured count above 9 is a **user decision surfaced at T31 before the spend**. The loud-failure argument (reason 2) is kept | §15.8, §15.11 AC-15.7, §15.12 T31 |
| **A-C7** | must-fix | conceded — recorded as amendment scope | The `in`/`not in` widening is recorded in §15.16.1 A3 as an amendment-scope item, **in scope of decision 5 by necessity** (it is the comparator that makes `:409`'s filter readable), **to be confirmed with the user at sprint close**; the header's *"nothing is pending user approval any more"* is softened to distinguish a pending *decision* from a pending *confirmation* | header, §15.16.1 A3 |
| **A-C8** | must-fix | adopted | Block (3)'s field is renamed **`n_env_ref_nodes`**; **`n_env_ref`** keeps the per-guard unit and appears only in block (4). The re-prediction table restates every cell as an exact `guards / nodes` pair with no hedged ranges; `move_*`'s old "4–5" is revealed as **4 / 5**, one count under each definition. AC-15.3 asserts the two names differ because the units do | §15.9 blocks (3)/(4) + table, §15.11 AC-15.3 |
| **A-C9** | should-fix | adopted | The row is renamed **T35**, which `TASK_ROW_RE` accepts (`plr-sema/scripts/check_spec_crossrefs.py:58` — `[a-z]?` is on the `#\d+` alternative only, so `T30c` was invisible to the lint). **AC-15.1 and AC-15.3 move from T30's gate cell to T35's** (T35 ships the final grammar and writes the report the gate is read from); AC-15.5(iii)'s new fixture stays with AC-15.5 on T31. Every AC is gated **exactly once** — `ac_multiply_gated`/`ac_ungated` (`plr-sema/scripts/check_spec_crossrefs.py:148-156`) enforce it, over the gate cell only — and none rides on a landed row. T30's gate cell is corrected to `t30_measured_260905.json`, the population re-run is named as `t30_measured_260907.json` (`15b84d31`), and T35's output is `t30_measured_260908.json` or later | §15.9, §15.11, §15.12, §15.15 |
| **A-C10** | should-fix | adopted — **deleted, not fixtured** | The membership deciding case is removed: every `in`/`not in` `Cmp` is ½ unconditionally. Recorded in §15.13 as a refused production with a three-part reopening condition (a literal-container `Term`; a normative statement of whether an `ir.Seq` is complete or a lower bound; a measured population plus counter). Also strengthens A-C2 | §15.2 G8(2), §15.4 E-ENV, §15.13 |
| **A-C11** | should-fix | adopted, all four | `InlinedGuard` is **nine** fields, none `caller_scope`, at `plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/__init__.py:491-499` (three sites re-anchored from the stale `:452-478`); `is_dynamic_raise` is cited at `:501-505` everywhere (§15.1's `:489-493` and the frontmatter's `:499-503` were both wrong; AC-15.6 was already right) | frontmatter, §15.1, §15.2 G0 box, §15.4 E-SCOPE, §15.9 |
| **A-C12** | note | adopted | The `Predicate`/`Term` partition break is recorded normatively: `EnvRef` belongs to **both** `_TERM_KINDS` and `_PREDICATE_KINDS` (`plr-sema/src/plr_sema/derive/predicate_ast.py:943-947`), `from_json` is unaffected because it dispatches on the tag. AC-15.1 fixture (e) pins the `args is None` (read) vs `args == ()` (zero-argument call) round-trip through `to_json`/`from_json` | §15.2 G7, §15.11 AC-15.1, §15.12 T35 |
| **A-C13** | note | adopted — the second option | **Normative:** a name bound by an `AllOf`/`AnyOf` comprehension target resolves to **⊤** and is **never** resolved against `call.kwargs`, even on a collision with a real parameter name. **No node gains a field**, so G8(1)'s "recorded nowhere" stays true and nothing downstream needs the correspondence | §15.4 E-ENV, §15.2 G8(1) |

**What round 2 did NOT do.** It re-opened no user decision (the five approvals of 260907 stand); it
adopted no new production — it **removed** one (membership deciding) and **narrowed** another (G7 shape
(2)); it spent no registry row, no vocabulary slot and no further ceiling; and it left §15.9's gate
condition exactly as it was. **The amendment is strictly narrower after the pass than before it**, and
the two numbers that moved — five flips became three, and one new refusal count — are both published.
