#: Bump on ANY change to synthesis logic or value pools (part of the RNG
#: seed, so bumps deliberately reshuffle the floor corpus).
#: 0.2.0 (260828): execution-verify wiring fixes in synth.py -- dotted
#: <name>.<id> ref grammar (was flat <name>_<id>, ungroundable) and
#: resource-list/volume-list cardinality coordination (was independently
#: sampled, producing internally-inconsistent "clean" calls). See
#: _grounded_symbolic/_literal_value docstrings.
#: 0.2.1 (260902, task 260902_p26b_surface_data): post-synthesis coercion to
#: the declared scalar/ARRAY surface (DECLARED_ARRAY_PARAMS) so the 60 rows
#: assembly 0.1.3 excluded become valid. DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to "bumps
#: reshuffle": the RNG seed now uses SYNTH_SEED_VERSION (frozen at 0.2.0) so
#: every previously accepted row stays byte-identical and the pinned
#: 228-row eval split is untouched (training/floor_gen/data/
#: floor_0.2.0_accepted_digests.json is the alarm).
