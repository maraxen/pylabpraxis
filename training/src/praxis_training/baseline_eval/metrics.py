"""Baseline metrics + Wilson intervals (P2.1 deliverable 2, AC-2.1.x, D8).

The THREE promotion-gate numbers (D8), computed per eval split:

- ``exact_match_accuracy``: fraction of examples whose parsed prediction
  agrees with the intent record on ALL axes via
  ``coxswain.plr.intent_record.check_intent_agreement`` -- which derives
  missing_required/unresolved_slots itself through slot_derivation (D11:
  model-predicted slots do not exist and are never scored).

- ``clarify_recall``: of the gold-clarify examples (intent calls empty OR any
  intended call carrying non-empty derived gaps), fraction where the
  prediction routes to a clarification.

- ``clarify_precision``: of the predictions that route to clarification,
  fraction that are truly gold-clarify.

Clarify routing rule (recorded, deterministic, STATIC scope): a prediction is
clarify-routing iff it produced NO parseable call, or ANY parseable call
derives non-empty ``missing_required`` (cue 1 fires without live state).
Both states trigger the same user-facing clarification UX in P2.8/P2.9.

Deliberately OUT of static clarify detection: ``unresolved_slots`` (cue 2).
Every string-valued resource arg derives a slot -- including the concrete,
groundable references of clean-parse calls -- so slots cannot separate
'ambiguous' from 'resolvable' without LIVE kernel state. Cue-2 resolution is
mandatory kernel-side validation before propose (F1-rev2/C-M1) and is
verified at P2.9 integration; here, ambiguous-referent rows contribute to
exact-match passthrough fidelity and carry their derived unresolved_slots in
the sidecar for downstream consumers. This boundary is restated in the
report under ``clarify_scope_note``.

A call to an unknown/excluded verb is NOT clarify-routing: it is a wrong-call
failure (kernel-side validation exits as an error, not a user question).

Wilson score intervals (Wilson 1927) accompany every point estimate at 95%
(z = two-sided normal quantile for 0.975). Chosen over Wald because golden
slices are small (n~60) and proportions near 0/1 are expected for a strong
baseline; Wilson keeps coverage there where Wald collapses.
