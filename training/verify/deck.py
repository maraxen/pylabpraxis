"""Deck construction for the P2.2 verify harness.

Wraps DeckFactory.create_setup from
praxis/backend/core/simulation/chatterbox_runner.py (loaded standalone,
SQLAlchemy-free -- see verifier.py) with:

* a declarative, serializable DeckLayout (resources by name + seeded well
  volumes + optional parking holders for gripper/move examples),
* layout INFERENCE from a call sequence (tiny decks by default: one tip rack
  plus exactly the resources the calls reference),
* state snapshotting used by the post-condition checks.

DeckFactory always builds the Hamilton carrier deck (TIP_CAR at rails=1,
PLT_CAR at rails=9) and names resources after their param entries; this
module keeps that behavior and only EXTENDS the returned setup.
