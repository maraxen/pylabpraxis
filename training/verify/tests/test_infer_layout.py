"""#4950: infer_layout() usage-based type inference.

infer_layout() used to decide a resource's PLR type purely by NAME PREFIX
("tip*" -> TipRack, "*trough" -> Trough, else Plate). #4950 makes it infer
from the call sequence's USAGE first (via the canonical
coxswain.plr.param_namespace table dispatcher.py already drives dispatch
from), falling back to the original prefix rule only when there is no usage
evidence -- and keeping the prefix rule verbatim (with a recorded warning)
when a base name is used BOTH as a tip target and a container/well target.
