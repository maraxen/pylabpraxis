## P2: Registry UI Issues

**Status**: Open
**Difficulty**: Medium

### Problem

The add machine button links to the add resource button. Add resource says "definitions are precinct in browser mode". We need a better UI for the registry.

### Tasks

- [ ] Fix navigation between add machine/resource
- [ ] Improve browser mode messaging for registry limitations
- [ ] Design clearer registry interface
- [ ] Consider read-only registry view for browser mode
