# Prompt 10: Resource Filter Chips Integration

**STATUS: IN PROGRESS - Being handled by another agent**

This prompt is reserved. The work includes:

- Integrating chip-based filters into Resource Inventory
- Resource filter chips (minimum: Status, Brand, Count, Type, Volume)
- Volume: use PLR's per-item volume attribute when available, fallback to name inference
- Variant detection: general algorithm for detecting related variants (not just PLT_CAR)
- Variant accordion: clicking variant indicator expands to show related variants
