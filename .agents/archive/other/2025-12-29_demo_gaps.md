# Demo Mode Gaps & Next Steps

Based on the user's feedback, the following tasks are prioritized to complete the Demo Mode experience.

## Consumables Logic

- [x] Implement a "Consumable" flag for resources (e.g., plates, tips).
- [x] Ensure users don't need to specify a new plate/tip rack for every experiment.
- [x] Add logic to generate unique IDs on the fly for consumables.
- [x] Add an optional resource count when adding consumables.
- [x] Default the consumable flag to `true` for itemized resources.

### Deck Visualizer (In Progress)

- [x] Port the PyLabRobot visualizer view into Praxis (cloned PLR source)
- [x] Investigate how to render the deck layout JSON/SVG in the frontend
- [x] Implement PLR iframe integration with mock data for Demo Mode
- [x] Integrate PLR visualizer into Run Protocol Page.

## Guided Deck Setup (In Progress - Compilation Error)

- [x] Implement Guided Deck Setup (Wizard to map requirements -> inventory)
- [x] Integrate with Run Protocol (Block run until setup confirmed)
- [x] Implement "Ghost" assets with pulsing animation for unconfigured items
- [ ] **FIX**: Compilation error in `RunProtocolComponent` (NG5002 - Unexpected closing tags). The template HTML structure is broken.
