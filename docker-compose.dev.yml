# Development override - ephemeral data (no persistent volumes)
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
#
# This configuration uses anonymous volumes instead of named volumes.
# Data is automatically deleted when containers are removed with `down -v`.

services:
  keycloak-postgres:
    # Override named volume with anonymous volume (deleted on `down -v`)
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/postgresql/data

  praxis-db:
    # Override named volume with anonymous volume (deleted on `down -v`)
    volumes:
