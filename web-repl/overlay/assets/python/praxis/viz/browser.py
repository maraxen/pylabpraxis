"""``BrowserVisualizer`` -- PyLabRobot's Visualizer with the servers removed (P6.4).

Stock ``Visualizer`` owns two servers: a websocket server for commands and an
HTTP file server for the renderer. Neither can exist in a Pyodide kernel, which
has no sockets and no threads. This subclass keeps **all** of PLR's serialization,
callback registration, and state batching, and replaces only the four members that
touch the socket:

  ``setup`` / ``stop`` / ``has_connection`` / ``send_command``

That set is not a guess. GATE G2 criterion 2 measured it, and also established
that the **+30-line callback-override fallback is NOT required**: every loop path
the inherited callbacks use -- ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe``,
``loop.call_soon_threadsafe``, ``loop.call_soon``, and ``asyncio.ensure_future``
-- works unshimmed on Pyodide's WebLoop
(``.praxia/docs/research/260817_g2-spike-battery-verdict.md`` Sec 5, Sec 8).

GATE X: if a fifth member ever needs overriding, STOP and escalate to V4
(upstream a transport hook into PLR). Override-count growth is a design
regression, not a maintenance chore.

Constructor note: ``Visualizer.__init__`` raises when ``HAS_WEBSOCKETS`` is False
(``visualizer.py:144`` at pin ``dd79c4c8``) -- the guard is in the constructor, not
in ``setup()``, so subclassing cannot dodge it. ``websockets-17.0.1`` is vendored
into ``overlay/assets/wheels/`` for exactly this reason; measured true in-kernel
under ``--offline`` (``repl_smoke.py --probe --offline`` step 2b:
``plr_has_websockets = true``). ``websockets`` is imported but never *used* here:
nothing in this class calls ``serve(...)``.
