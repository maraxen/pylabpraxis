"""Conformance test for ``plr_contract.py`` (ADR Sec 4.3 row: "survives
unchanged" from the old ``praxis-browser/tests/test_plr_contract.py" --
still runs in a throwaway venv so ``pylabrobot.__file__`` is NOT under
``external/``). Wheel spec T15 (:325-330) and R17/R17b define what this
file must prove.

WHY THE THROWAWAY VENV IS NOT OPTIONAL: root ``pyproject.toml``
(``[tool.uv.sources] pylabrobot = { path = "external/pylabrobot", editable =
true }``) installs pylabrobot as an EDITABLE PATH install. Any test run in
THIS repo's own venv therefore imports the submodule SOURCE, not the built
wheel this contract is actually meant to gate -- and would pass unchanged
even against an empty wheel. Every conformance assertion below runs inside
a disposable venv, built fresh per test session, with ONLY the wheels named
in the manifest installed ``--no-deps`` -- exactly what the browser's
micropip install does (``deps=False`` at every call site, wheel spec :192).

WHAT "THE FILTER" MEANS HERE: ``plr_contract.CONTRACT`` is a hand-curated
subset of pylabrobot's namespace -- not a generated view filtered out of the
live package (see ``plr_contract.py``'s own docstring for why a live-filter
design would fail exactly the same shadowing test this file exists to
apply). "The filter" is that curation: a bug in it looks like an
under-inclusive list (silently empty, or missing a symbol the product
depends on -- passes conformance trivially) or an over-inclusive one
(accidentally covers scope the browser payload has no business depending
on). ``test_contract_is_non_empty``, ``test_contract_contains_known_symbols``,
and the two rejection tests below exercise both failure directions.

WHY THIS FILE DOES NOT ALSO BUILD THE AST-SUPERSET TEST: ADR Sec 2.3's D3
row (``web-repl/tests/test_contract_covers_imports.py``) already asserts
"first-party pylabrobot imports are a subset of the contract's module set"
-- which is the identical statement to "the contract is a superset of
first-party imports," not a complementary direction. That file exists
already (built by a parallel task this round) with a documented, deliberate
``_CONTRACT_MODULES`` stand-in and a note to swap it for
``{path for path, _symbol in plr_contract.CONTRACT}`` once this file
landed. ``plr_contract.CONTRACT``'s module set is a deliberate superset of
that stand-in (see ``plr_contract.py``'s own docstring) so the swap is a
no-op, but performing the swap itself is D3's file to edit, not this one's.

Pure CPython for the outer pytest process; the wheel-backed arms below shell
out to a throwaway venv's own interpreter for the parts that must run
against the built wheel.

# `pyserial` is deliberately not installed (that is what `--no-deps` means,
# mirroring the browser's `deps=False`), so the module-shaped stand-in is
# required for the import to resolve at all.
#
# `web_repl.bootstrap.stages.install_native_stubs()` was deliberately NOT
# reused here instead: RAN -- calling it in a plain CPython venv (unlike
# Pyodide, where `ssl` genuinely does not work) unconditionally REPLACES the
# real stdlib `ssl` module with a bare, attribute-less stand-in the moment
# `ssl` is not yet in `sys.modules`, which breaks `asyncio.sslproto`
# (`AttributeError: module 'ssl' has no attribute 'SSLWantReadError'`) the

# does, at package-import time). `_NATIVE_STUBS_PRELUDE` never touches
