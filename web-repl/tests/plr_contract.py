"""Declarative pylabrobot symbol contract for the web REPL browser payload.

Wheel spec ``.praxia/docs/specs/260817_spec-wheel-build-plr-upgrade.md``
T15 (:325-329) and ADR
``.praxia/docs/decisions/260817_repl-layout-and-delivery-mechanism.md``
Sec 4.3 describe this file as "a module-level tuple of (module_path,
symbol_name) covering everything the browser path needs -- at minimum
pylabrobot.io.{serial.Serial,usb.USB,hid.HID,ftdi.FTDI} plus
HAS_SERIAL/USE_USB/USE_HID/HAS_PYLIBFTDI, pylabrobot.resources.{Deck,
Resource,Plate,Well,TipRack,TipSpot,Container,create_equally_spaced_2d},
pylabrobot.resources.carrier.PlateHolder,
pylabrobot.resources.resource_holder.ResourceHolder,
pylabrobot.resources.coordinate.Coordinate, and the six experimental machine
frontends including pylabrobot.storage.Incubator."

CONTRACT is intentionally a SUPERSET of that "at minimum" list: it also
covers the deeper submodules the current browser source (``web_bridge.py``,
``web_ftdi_shim.py``) actually imports for the deferred/experimental machine
paths (``pylabrobot.liquid_handling.backends[.hamilton]``,
``pylabrobot.plate_reading.clario_star_backend``) -- these are exactly the
module set ``web-repl/tests/test_contract_covers_imports.py`` (D3, ADR
Sec 2.3) checks first-party imports against. D3's own module docstring
records the intended wiring once this file exists: replace its stand-in
``_CONTRACT_MODULES`` with ``{path for path, _symbol in
plr_contract.CONTRACT}``. Keeping this file's module set a strict superset
of D3's stand-in list is what makes that swap a no-op instead of a new
failure.

THE INCUBATOR ENTRY IS DELIBERATELY THE CORRECTED PATH.
``pylabrobot.incubator`` does not exist at the pinned submodule sha
(``d9651e2098cd269fc47e6aff80c9242a82d1b587``) -- ``pylabrobot.storage`` is
the only real home for ``Incubator`` at this pin (spike-verified,
``.praxia/docs/research/260817_spike-evidence-repl-refocus.md`` :259).
``web_bridge.py``'s still-inline ``_MACHINE_CLASS_MAP`` has NOT been fixed
yet (that is Phase 4 / P4.2, a separate task) and still maps to the stale
``pylabrobot.incubator`` string -- this contract does not, and must not,
list that stale path. ``test_plr_contract.py``'s filter self-test asserts
this directly: the stale entry is absent, proving CONTRACT is a curated
list, not "whatever currently happens to import."

WHY THIS IS A BARE TUPLE, NOT A GENERATED/FILTERED VIEW OF PLR's OWN
namespace: pyproject.toml's ``pylabrobot = {path = "external/pylabrobot",
editable = true}`` source means a filter walking the live PLR package would
silently probe the submodule, not the built wheel -- exactly the shadowing
bug ``test_plr_contract.py`` exists to catch. A hand-curated, static tuple
has no such failure mode: it names what the product needs regardless of
which pylabrobot install is on ``sys.path``.
