"""Praxis browser-Python bootstrap -- the ordered, fail-closed loader.

Per ADR ``.praxia/docs/decisions/260817_repl-layout-and-delivery-mechanism.md``
Sec 2.1, this file is the "ordered fail-closed driver; SINGLE OWNER", and the
old separate ``boot.py`` design is MERGED into it (Sec 4.3): this module owns
the ordered stage ledger and sequences it. It does NOT own the error
taxonomy, ``install_native_stubs()``, ``apply()``/``assert_identity()``, or
``import_shim_class()`` -- ``stages.py`` (in this same directory) owns all of
those; this file imports and sequences them. It does not own the D2 fetch
primitives or the D1 handshake body either -- ``transport.py`` owns those,
kept ``import js``-free so they are CPython-unit-testable. Per the plan's
P3.7 design intent, ``praxis_main()`` -- the actual ordered stage sequence --
is kept short by construction: the logic lives in ``stages``/``transport``,
this function only calls into it in order and stops on the first failure.

Entry point: called exactly as the old file was --
``asyncio.ensure_future(praxis_main(HOST_ROOT))`` by the minimal external
bootstrap snippet that fetches this file's own source over a synchronous XHR
and ``exec``s it (``playground-jupyterlite.service.ts`` today; its
standalone-site successor is Phase 5, out of this task's scope). That
snippet is this file's only caller and the only place ``host_root`` comes
from -- signature and name are kept exactly so nothing there needs to change.

**Why this file itself fetches two more files before doing anything else**
(``_bootstrap_loader_modules``, below): ``stages.py`` and ``transport.py``
live in ``web-repl/bootstrap/``, which sits OUTSIDE
``overlay/assets/{shims,python}`` -- ``build_manifest.py``'s own
``SOURCE_SUBDIRS`` -- so ``manifest.json`` structurally cannot list them
(ADR Sec 2.3's D2 table: the "sources" array is built by walking exactly
those two subdirectories). They ARE the code that makes manifest-driven
fetching possible, so fetching them cannot itself be manifest-driven; this
is the one and only hardcoded-URL exception, and it is a categorically
different thing from the seven hardcoded literals this rewrite removes
(four shims, ``web_bridge.py``, ``praxis/__init__.py``,
``praxis/interactive.py`` -- all now driven by ``transport.fetch_sources()``
reading ``manifest.json``'s "sources" array).

**Why this satisfies the "``praxis_boot_errors`` must be reachable before
any wheel is" requirement without a synthetic module**: this file imports
``stages`` (and therefore the whole ``PraxisBootError`` taxonomy) as
literally its first action, before ``manifest.json`` is even fetched. A
manifest-404 or a wheel-404 therefore always has ``PraxisUnavailableError``
available to raise it with -- the taxonomy's single home in ``stages.py`` (a
loose file, not a wheel) already satisfies the requirement, so no second,
synthetic ``praxis_boot_errors`` module is built here. See this task's
report for the full reasoning.

**Fail-closed, end to end:** every stage after the two-file self-bootstrap
runs inside one ``try`` whose ``except`` posts ``{"type": "praxis:error",
"reason": ...}`` on the ``praxis_repl`` BroadcastChannel and returns WITHOUT
ever reaching the ``{"type": "praxis:ready"}`` post at the very end of the
``try`` body. That is what moves ``praxis:ready`` INSIDE the guarded region
(P3.8): the old file posted it unconditionally after a separate,
already-swallowed wheel-install failure (old ``:239-246`` logs and falls
through; old ``:286-293`` posts ready regardless) -- the demonstrated live
bomb where renaming the wheel produced a 404, PyLabRobot never installed,
and ``praxis:ready`` fired anyway with ``builtins.Plate`` absent.
