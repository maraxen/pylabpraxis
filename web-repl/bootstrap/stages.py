"""Boot-stage building blocks for praxis's browser-Python bootstrap.

Pure CPython -- no ``import js``, no fetching, no Pyodide-VFS writes (ADR
260817_repl-layout-and-delivery-mechanism.md SS2.1/SS3.1: this is one of the
two files that generalizes the one CPython-testability win the loader already
had). This module owns THREE things, per that ADR:

1. **The boot error taxonomy** (SS4.3) -- ``PraxisBootError``,
   ``PraxisDriftError``, ``PraxisUnavailableError``. This is their ONLY home.
   A prior design kept a second copy in ``errors.py`` with a
   ``sys.modules``-shadowing trick to avoid a two-class-object split; that
   design is DROPPED here, not reproduced, because with one home the risk it
   guarded against does not exist.

2. **``install_native_stubs()``** -- replaces the old ``_mock_native_deps()``
   MagicMock entirely with real ``types.ModuleType`` objects for the seven
   dotted names PyLabRobot's capability probes ``try: import X`` against.
   *That MagicMock was load-bearing*: PLR's ``HAS_SERIAL`` / ``USE_USB`` /
   ``USE_HID`` / ``HAS_PYLIBFTDI`` flags are module-scope
   ``try: import X / except ImportError: HAS_X = False`` booleans evaluated
   ONCE at import time -- a naive removal flips all four False silently.

3. **``apply()`` / ``verify_identity()``** -- the home of the single-class-
   object identity invariant (ADR SS2.2, "R-ID"). ``apply()`` patches
   ``pylabrobot.io.{serial.Serial, usb.USB, hid.HID, ftdi.FTDI}`` from their
   ``builtins.Web*`` shim classes; its own post-write assert is a cheap
   consistency check on that write, not the invariant -- it fires one line
   after its own ``setattr`` and cannot observe a LATER rebind.
   ``verify_identity()`` is the actual enforcement point: same assert, by
   ``is`` -- never by name -- called again by the caller AFTER everything
   that could still rebind a ``builtins.Web*`` name has run. Both are
   fail-closed: raise ``PraxisDriftError`` immediately, never warn.

**Contract with the caller** (``web-repl/bootstrap/praxis_bootstrap.py`` --
a SEPARATE task owns that file; this module defines the interface it calls
into, it does not call itself):

    # 1. Fetch shim/web_bridge/praxis-package source over XHR and write it
    #    into the Pyodide VFS. (praxis_bootstrap.py's job -- needs `js`.)
    ...

    # 2. Import each shim EXACTLY ONCE via `import_shim_class` (R-ID) and
    #    staple the result onto builtins. MUST happen before step 3, because
    #    `install_native_stubs()`'s postcondition requires
    #    `sys.modules['serial'].Serial is WebSerial` immediately.
    import builtins
    builtins.WebSerial = stages.import_shim_class("web_serial_shim", "WebSerial")
    builtins.WebUSB    = stages.import_shim_class("web_usb_shim",    "WebUSB")
    builtins.WebHID    = stages.import_shim_class("web_hid_shim",    "WebHID")
    builtins.WebFTDI   = stages.import_shim_class("web_ftdi_shim",   "WebFTDI")

    # 3. Install the native stubs -- BEFORE any `import pylabrobot`.
    stages.install_native_stubs(web_serial_cls=builtins.WebSerial)

    # 4. Install wheels, `import pylabrobot`, etc. (loader's job.)
    ...

    # 5. Patch pylabrobot.io from the shims (cheap post-write consistency
    #    check only -- NOT the R-ID enforcement point).
    stages.apply()

    # 6. web_bridge.bootstrap_playground() and anything else that could still
    #    rebind a builtins.Web* name runs here. (loader's job.)
    ...

    # 7. THE R-ID enforcement point (ADR SS2.2): assert-only, no setattr,
    #    called last, immediately before praxis:ready.
    stages.verify_identity()

``import_shim_class`` is the ONLY sanctioned way to turn fetched shim source
into a class object: it is a plain, memoized ``importlib.import_module`` call
-- there is no ``exec`` anywhere in this file, into a throwaway namespace or
otherwise. That is deliberate and structural, not incidental: ``exec(src, {})``
is the exact mechanism ADR SS2.2 identifies as manufacturing a SECOND, distinct
class object under the same name every time it runs (the ADR calls the two
resulting objects "class A" and "class B"). A second call to
``import_shim_class`` with the same module name returns the cached
``sys.modules`` entry, so the class object it hands back is identical, by
``is``, to the first call's -- not merely equal by name or repr.

    PyLabRobot's ``try: import X`` capability probes need these to succeed so
    ``HAS_SERIAL`` evaluates True in a browser where ``serial`` does not
    actually exist. Measured against the real built wheels
    (``pylabrobot-0.2.2+gdd79c4c8`` + the fixed ``pylibftdi`` stub wheel;
    re-measured 260818 after the Phase 4 pin bump -- values unchanged),
    before ``apply()``, with these seven names stubbed:
    ``{'HAS_SERIAL': True, 'USE_USB': False, 'USE_HID': False,
    'HAS_PYLIBFTDI': True}``. Do NOT assume this function makes all four
    PLR capability flags True -- it does not, and never claimed to for two
    of them once you check PLR's own source rather than PLR's docstrings:

    - ``HAS_SERIAL`` -- True, via the ``serial`` stub this function installs.
    - ``HAS_PYLIBFTDI`` -- True, but NOT because of this function: PLR's own
      ``pylabrobot.io.ftdi`` does ``try: import pylibftdi.driver; from
      pylibftdi import Device, FtdiError`` against the real, separately
      installed ``pylibftdi`` stub *wheel* (``web-repl/scripts/
      pylibftdi_stub/``), not against anything in ``NATIVE_STUB_MODULES``.
    - ``USE_USB`` / ``USE_HID`` -- False, and structurally so: PLR gates them
      on ``import libusb_package`` (``pylabrobot/io/usb.py``) and
      ``import hid`` (``pylabrobot/io/hid.py``) respectively, and neither
      ``libusb_package`` nor ``hid`` is one of the seven names stubbed here
      or anywhere else in this bootstrap. This is deliberate, not an
      oversight: both flags are read ONLY inside the ORIGINAL
      ``pylabrobot.io.usb.USB`` / ``pylabrobot.io.hid.HID`` classes' own
      ``setup()`` methods (verified by
      ``git -C external/pylabrobot grep -n USE_USB USE_HID`` -- no other
      file reads either name), and ``apply()`` replaces those classes
      wholesale with ``WebUSB`` / ``WebHID`` -- independent implementations
      (``web-repl/overlay/assets/shims/web_{usb,hid}_shim.py``) that never
      consult ``USE_USB``/``USE_HID`` at all. The flags gate no code path
      the browser REPL reaches; stubbing ``libusb_package``/``hid`` just to
      flip two dead flags True would add stub surface for no behavioral
      gain, so this function leaves them unstubbed and False on purpose.

    The seven stub names are load-bearing beyond the four flags above,
    though: ``pylabrobot/storage/cytomat/cytomat.py`` does a bare
    module-scope ``import serial`` with NO ``try/except`` -- it only
    succeeds in a browser because this function ran first and put a
    ``serial`` module in ``sys.modules``. That matters for Phase 4, since
    ``Incubator`` moves into ``pylabrobot.storage``.

    Not classes. Not ``unittest.mock.MagicMock``. Not bare ``object()``s --
    real ``types.ModuleType`` instances, because a downstream check asserts
    ``'unittest.mock' not in type(sys.modules['serial']).__module__``.

    MUST be called before any ``import pylabrobot`` (or submodule of it) --
    PLR's flags are checked once and never re-evaluated.

    Idempotent / non-destructive: a name already present in ``sys.modules``
    (e.g. CPython's own real stdlib ``ssl``) is left untouched -- this is the
    same guard the old ``_mock_native_deps()`` used
    (``if mod_name not in sys.modules: ...``), preserved here on purpose so a
    module that is genuinely real and working is never shadowed by a stub.

    ``web_serial_cls``, if given, is stapled onto the stub ``serial`` module
    as ``serial.Serial`` -- this is what lets the immediately-following boot
    postcondition ``sys.modules['serial'].Serial is WebSerial`` hold. Passing
    ``None`` (the default) is supported for isolated testing of the stub
    machinery itself, independent of any shim class.
