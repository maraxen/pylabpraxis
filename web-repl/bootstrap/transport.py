"""Manifest-driven fetch + D2 integrity verification for the browser bootstrap.

Pure CPython -- no ``import js`` anywhere in this module (ADR
``.praxia/docs/decisions/260817_repl-layout-and-delivery-mechanism.md``
Sec 2.1: "``transport.py``: ``_sync_fetch -> (ok, status, text)``; no
``import js``. That constraint exists so the transport is unit-testable in
CPython."). Every function that needs a browser object (an XHR-like fetcher,
a BroadcastChannel-like message pump) takes it as an injected callable or
object instead of importing ``js`` to construct one itself -- that is what
makes every function in this module exercisable from a plain CPython pytest
run with fake stand-ins, never a real browser.

This module owns:

1. ``_sync_fetch`` -- the low-level synchronous fetch primitive, browser
   object injected.
2. ``fetch_manifest`` -- fetch + parse ``manifest.json``, fail closed
   (``PraxisUnavailableError``) on a missing file or malformed JSON.
3. ``fetch_sources`` -- THE fetch loop this task exists to fix. Reads the
   manifest's ``"sources"`` array (built dynamically by
   ``build_manifest.py``'s ``collect_sources()`` from everything under
   ``overlay/assets/{shims,python}``) instead of iterating a hardcoded list
   of URL literals, verifies each fetched file's sha256 against its manifest
   entry (D2), and writes it into the Pyodide VFS. This is what brings the
   old file's seven hardcoded fetch literals (four shims, ``web_bridge.py``,
   ``praxis/__init__.py``, ``praxis/interactive.py`` -- ADR Sec 2.3) under
   the manifest seam, and it does so for whatever the manifest lists, not
   just those seven -- ``praxis/viz/*``, ``experimental/*``, and the shims'
   own ``__init__.py`` all ride the same loop with no further code.
4. ``shell_ping`` -- the bootstrap-side half of the D1 ``praxis:shell-ping``
   / ``praxis:shell-pong`` handshake (ADR Sec 2.3; wire protocol defined in
   ``web-repl/shell/praxis-shell.js``). Takes an already-bound
   ``register_handler`` callable and a ``post_fn`` callable rather than
   constructing or touching a ``BroadcastChannel`` itself, so it is testable
   against a bare Python stand-in object.

``stages.py`` owns the error taxonomy (``PraxisBootError`` /
``PraxisDriftError`` / ``PraxisUnavailableError``) -- this module imports it
rather than redefining anything, per ADR Sec 4.3 ("the taxonomy has exactly
one home").

    Shims flatten to the VFS root (``assets/shims/web_serial_shim.py`` ->
    ``web_serial_shim.py``) because ``stages.import_shim_class()`` imports
    each one by bare module name (its own docstring's worked example:
    ``import_module("web_serial_shim")``) -- this is the R-ID contract
    (ADR Sec 2.2), not a naming preference.

    Everything under ``assets/python/`` keeps its structure minus that one
    prefix, so ``assets/python/praxis/interactive.py`` ->
    ``praxis/interactive.py`` and ``import praxis.interactive`` resolves as
    a regular package (ADR Sec 2.4 pins ``praxis/__init__.py`` as a regular,
    non-namespace package).

    Raises ``PraxisUnavailableError`` on a path outside both prefixes --
    build_manifest.py's ``collect_sources()`` can only ever produce paths
    under ``SOURCE_SUBDIRS = ("shims", "python")``, so this is a "the
    manifest shape changed under us" guard, not a reachable case today.

    Also raises ``PraxisUnavailableError``, fail-closed, if the computed
    destination is a bare ``__init__.py`` landing at the VFS root (``dest_root``
    itself, e.g. ``assets/shims/__init__.py`` -> ``__init__.py``). That would
    silently turn the bootstrap's own working directory into a Python
    package -- the same directory ``stages.py``, ``transport.py`` and every
    fetched shim/source file are written into -- which can change import
    resolution in ways that are very hard to debug later (F-VFS). This is a
    belt-and-suspenders check: ``build_manifest.py``'s ``collect_sources()``
    is the primary fix (it never emits ``assets/shims/__init__.py`` as a
    source at all, because shims are imported as bare top-level modules --
    ``stages.import_shim_class()`` -- never through a ``shims`` package), but
    this function fails loud rather than silently writing a root-level
