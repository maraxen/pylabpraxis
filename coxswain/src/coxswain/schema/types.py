"""Structural safety types per spec §3.3: risk tiers, cue identifiers, the
closed disposition enum, the per-cue exit payload types, and
``OVERRIDABLE_CUES``.

Design constraint (§3.3, binding): widening override scope must require a
source change to ``OVERRIDABLE_CUES`` plus a new spec decision. It must never
be achievable by configuration, environment variable, build flag, feature
toggle, URL parameter, or support ticket. The exit payload types for cues 0,
1 and 2 do not carry override affordance fields at all, so an over-eager UI
cannot render an override control for them even by mistake.
