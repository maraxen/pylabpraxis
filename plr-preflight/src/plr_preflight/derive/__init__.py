"""plr_preflight.derive: transitive-closure contract derivation (spec 260901 §7).

**Mechanics only** (§7 header). This module specifies graph plumbing over
data that already exists on disk (``training/verify/data/plr_preconditions.json``,
§7.1) plus one independent, second AST pass over PLR source itself. It
specifies no predicate semantics, no abstract domain, no loop handling --
``condition``/``scope_trail`` stay opaque strings (deferred item (c)).

**RISK-1 detector (§7.6).** This is the single biggest content-risk
detection mechanism in the whole document: whether closure over
``delegates_to`` recovers materially more preconditions than a method's own
body, or whether derivation is sound-but-empty. The gap ledger this module
builds is the measurement; see ``build_gap_ledger``.

**Independence (§1.4).** This module (and the rest of ``src/plr_preflight``) must
not import ``praxis``, ``verify``, or ``training`` -- enforced by
``tests/test_import_boundary.py``, which scans the whole ``src/plr_preflight``
tree including this package. The dropped-receiver AST pass below
(``scan_dropped_receiver_calls``) is a SECOND, INDEPENDENT stdlib-``ast``
walk over PLR source under ``external/`` -- it does not reuse the survey
JSON or import ``scripts/survey_plr_preconditions.py`` at all, by design
(§7.4's asymmetry note: the point is a measurement that doesn't share the
survey's own blind spot).

Contents:
  * ``SurveyRecord``/``SurveyFinding`` -- typed views of the survey JSON.
  * ``load_survey``/``build_index`` -- load + key by ``(module, qualname)``.
  * ``resolve`` -- bare delegate-name resolution (§7.2, C1), class-first.
  * ``InlinedGuard``/``DerivedContract``/``derive_contract`` -- the
    transitive closure mechanic itself (§7.2).
  * ``SUPPORTED_TOOLS``/``resolve_supported_tool`` -- the D22 derived
    name-to-key mapping for the 10-tool dynamic execution harness capability
    boundary (260901 T11: informational only now -- ``build_gap_ledger``'s
    ``supported_tools``-scoped reporting subset; no longer gates which
    methods get a contract, see ``build_derived_contracts_payload``).
  * ``build_contract_keys`` -- the whole-survey contract-table key
    disambiguator (260901 T11).
  * ``scan_dropped_receiver_calls`` and friends -- the independent D3 AST
    pass computing, per method, the honest and validation-looking
    dropped-receiver call-node counts.
  * ``build_gap_ledger`` -- the generated build artifact (§7.4).

    1. ``@property``/``@x.setter`` pairs -- SAME ``(module, qualname)``,
       different ``lineno`` (8 finding-bearing pairs, 12 over the whole
       4,770-record survey; ``count_index_key_collisions`` measures this
       population). ``build_index``'s own docstring already documents this
       source.
    2. Distinct module-level functions in DIFFERENT modules that happen to
       share a bare name -- e.g. ``_height_of_volume_in_spherical_cap`` is
       defined once in ``pylabrobot.resources.height_functions`` and again,
       unrelated, in ``pylabrobot.resources.height_volume_functions``. These

       pairs among finding-bearing records, 18 total finding-bearing
       collisions, 26 over the whole 4,770-record survey. This source is
       new to this task's own measurement; it was not in the brief.

    **Disambiguator (single, uniform rule, chosen over a two-tier one for
    testability):** if ``qualname`` is unique among ``records``, the key is
    the bare ``qualname``. Otherwise the key is
    ``f"{qualname}@{module}:{lineno}"`` -- ``(module, qualname, lineno)`` is
    proven collision-free by construction (``build_unique_index``'s own
    assertion: two records in one module cannot share a definition line),
    so this is collision-free for BOTH sources above without needing to
    branch on which source produced the collision.

    **Known, accepted limitation, stated rather than silently worked
    around:** a colliding method's DISAMBIGUATED key is unreachable via
    ``check/``'s lookup format (bare ``f"{receiver_type}.{method_name}"``,
    §6.2 -- ``OperationNode`` carries no module or line number). This is
    honest, not a regression: every measured collision is either a
    property/setter pair (accessed via attribute syntax, never emitted as
    an ``OperationNode`` by the extractor, which only records ``ast.Call``
    sites, per ``computation_graph_extractor.py``) or a module-level
    function with no receiver at all (never reachable through
    ``receiver_type.method_name`` in the first place, since it has no
    receiver). No entry point any real graph could name is made
    unreachable by this choice.

    `delegates_to` closure walk -- because a surface with no orchestration
    layer has no principled notion of "entry point" to walk a closure FROM
    in the first place (every driver method is potentially its own caller).
    This is the same population and blocks_methods semantics

    `_dropped_receiver_worklist_from_survey` (every finding-bearing record,
    not just the ~10-tool closure) -- both views are published side by side
    (see `build_gap_ledger`) rather than one replacing the other, since they
    answer different questions ("what does the whole surface drop?" vs.
    "what does the loadable-from-a-tool-entry-point closure drop?").

    Same `_is_inert_dropped_receiver_call` filter, same unfiltered/filtered
    pairing convention as `_dropped_receiver_worklist_from_survey` (round-5
    T0 item 4) -- an unfiltered ranking over a driver-method population
    saturates on its OWN inert population (logging/plumbing calls inside
    driver bodies), not necessarily the same names `_check_args` saturated
    on for the orchestration layer; see this task's report for whether the
    existing filter table transfers as-is.

    `(module, qualname)` keys.** The two closure-based worklists
    (`_dropped_receiver_worklist`/`_dropped_receiver_worklist_from_survey`)
    dedupe against a `set[Qualkey]` because `_walk_closure` can genuinely
    revisit the SAME key from more than one tool entry point's closure, and
    `Qualkey` collisions never arise there since closure traversal is keyed
    off the SAME `(module, qualname)`-collapsing `index` `derive_contract`
    itself uses. This function has neither property: `records` is iterated
    flatly, once, with no possibility of revisiting a record twice, so no
    dedup step is needed at all -- and using `(module, qualname)` as a dedup
    key here would have been actively WRONG, not merely unnecessary: it
    silently collapses any two DISTINCT records that happen to share a
    `(module, qualname)` (F6's property/setter-pair collision, still real at

    """Build the gap ledger (§7.4) -- a generated build artifact, never
    hand-maintained (decision 7).

    ``totals``/``by_reason``/``top_unresolved.whole_surface`` are computed
    over the whole surface's 1,314 finding-bearing functions (§7.6: "run
    the closure over all 1,314 finding-bearing functions"). ``supported_tools``
    and the two per-method dicts are the SUPPORTED_TOOLS-only figures AC-7.4
    requires published (three commensurable method counts:
    ``methods_attempted``, ``methods_with_no_recorded_gap``,
    ``methods_with_dropped_receiver_call`` -- plus the two per-method
    call-node counts as secondary diagnostics, never a denominator, trap 8).

    ``by_category`` is keyed on ``FAILURE_CATEGORIES`` (§7 task-table note),
    with every value ``None`` in v1 (round-4 remediation, M3 -- previously
    ``0`` for every category, which reads as a MEASUREMENT of zero, not as
    "not applicable"). A gap here only ever produces an UNKNOWN finding
    downstream (reason, not category -- category is required only for
    WILL_FAIL per ``Finding.__post_init__``), and §0 fixes every v1 verdict
    at UNKNOWN, so no gap this module records is EVER classified into a
    FAILURE_CATEGORY in round 1 -- there is no detection mechanism for
    RISK-4's tripwire yet (that only becomes live once ``WILL_FAIL`` is
    first emitted, a future round). The sibling ``by_category_status`` field
    makes that explicit rather than leaving a reader to infer it from six
    identical zeros. The block is still published (schema completeness,
    forward-compatible with a future round that does classify) rather than
    omitted.

    Round-4 remediation (M11): ``totals["methods_with_dropped_receiver_call"]``
    used to be computed over ALL 4,758 indexed records while
    ``methods_attempted`` counted only the 1,314 finding-bearing ones -- a
    population mismatch that let the subset figure exceed its own
    denominator (1976 > 1314). Both are now computed over the SAME
    ``finding_bearing`` population. Separately (M11 second half),
    ``dropped_receiver_calls_by_method``/``validation_looking_dropped_
    receiver_calls_by_method`` are now summed over each ``SUPPORTED_TOOLS``
    method's WHOLE transitive closure (``_closure_wide_dropped_receiver_
    counts``), not just its own body -- see that function's docstring.
    ``top_unresolved`` gains a third view, ``dropped_receiver`` (M12/Cluster
    3/B3(e)): the D3 population ranked into an actual worklist, since it
    structurally never enters ``unresolved_calls`` and so was invisible to
    the other two views.

    Round-5 T0 item 4: ``top_unresolved.dropped_receiver`` is now sourced
    from the survey's own ``dropped_calls`` field (F1) instead of the D3
    pass's bare ``by_attr`` breakdown, so its rows are receiver-qualified
    (``self.head[channel].get_tip``, not bare ``get_tip``) and filtered
    (``_is_inert_dropped_receiver_call``) to keep an unfiltered
    ``LiquidHandler._check_args``-dominated saturation from burying the real
    signal (round-5 defense, F1). The pre-filter ranking is published
    alongside it as ``dropped_receiver_unfiltered`` rather than discarded,
    so the filter's effect is auditable from the artifact itself. The D3
    pass and its own two counters (``dropped_receiver_calls_by_method``,
    ``validation_looking_dropped_receiver_calls_by_method``, and
    ``totals``/``supported_tools``'s ``methods_with_dropped_receiver_call``)
    are UNCHANGED -- round 5 declined deleting T6's second, independent AST
    pass (it is the only one of the measured variants that sees guard sites
    behind ``if``/``raise``/``assert`` tests, per F6).

    260901 T14 (backlog #4862): two further ``top_unresolved`` views,
    ``dropped_receiver_whole_surface``/``_unfiltered`` -- the deferred-item-
    (e) worklist for a surface with no orchestration layer to derive
    ``tool_keys`` from at all (``upstream_nonlegacy``: ``liquid_handler_
    present`` is False there, so ``dropped_receiver``/``dropped_receiver_
    unfiltered`` above are structurally empty, not just small -- see
    ``_dropped_receiver_worklist_whole_surface``'s docstring). Ranked the
    same way as ``top_whole`` (own-body, no closure walk, over the whole
    ``finding_bearing`` population) rather than gated on ``tool_keys``, so
    it is populated regardless of ``liquid_handler_present``. Published
    alongside, not instead of, the closure-based pair -- they measure
    different populations and neither is a strict superset of the other.
    Dedupes on the collision-free ``(module, qualname, lineno)`` record
    identity, NOT ``(module, qualname)`` -- see
    ``_dropped_receiver_worklist_whole_surface``'s own docstring for why a
    plain ``Qualkey`` dedup would silently undercount every
    property/setter-pair collision (F6, the same population
    ``index_key_collisions`` below measures).

    Round-5 T0 item 2 (F6): ``index_key_collisions`` reports how many
    ``(module, qualname)`` keys ``build_index`` collapses -- see
    ``count_index_key_collisions``. ``methods_attempted`` still counts
    RECORDS (1,314 at the current pin); any structure keyed on
    ``(module, qualname)`` sees ``1,314 - index_key_collisions[
    "finding_bearing_records"]`` distinct keys instead. This is the
    671-vs-667 population footnote (§7.4): the whole-surface
    ``methods_with_dropped_receiver_call`` (671) is computed over the SAME
    record population as ``methods_attempted`` (M11), so it is NOT reduced
    by the collision the way a keyed traversal would be.

    260901 T11: ``contract_table`` reports the SEPARATE collision population
    that ``build_derived_contracts_payload`` (``plr_preflight.derive.__main__``)
    actually keys on -- the whole 4,770-record survey's bare ``qualname``
    (not ``index_key_collisions``' ``(module, qualname)``). This is a
    strictly larger collision count (26 vs. 12 at the current pin) because
    it also catches same-named module-level functions defined in DIFFERENT
    modules, which ``(module, qualname)`` does not see as colliding at all
    -- see ``build_contract_keys``' docstring for the two independent
    sources and the disambiguator. ``total_entries`` always equals
    ``len(records)`` (every record gets exactly one key, collision-free by
    construction); ``disambiguated_keys`` is how many of those entries
    needed the ``@module:lineno`` suffix rather than the bare qualname.
